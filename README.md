# <img src="images/together.gif" width="250"/> Cookbook

The Together Cookbook is a collection of code and guides designed to help developers build with open source models using [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/). The best way to use the recipes is to copy code snippets and integrate them into your own projects!

## Prerequisites

To make the most of the examples in this cookbook, you'll need a Together AI API key (sign up for free [here](https://api.together.ai/signin)).

While the code examples are primarily written in Python/JS, the concepts can be adapted to any programming language that supports interaction with the Together API.
