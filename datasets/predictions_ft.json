{"predictions_ft_syn":["The Mudejars, Muslims living in Christian-majority Valencia, maintained their Islamic identity and social cohesion in the face of overwhelming Christian domination. Despite significant acculturation to Christian culture, particularly in urban centers, they continued to practice endogamy and uphold the importance of agnatic solidarity. They organized their social structures around family and lineage, with feuding being a common occurrence. However, the Mudejars also developed mechanisms to resolve conflicts and maintain a degree of community solidarity.\n\nThe Arabo-Berber social structures of the Mudejars, including their segmentary system and emphasis on casabiyah (kinship and solidarity), played a significant role in shaping their social organization and identity. Heavy taxes and seigneurial control, on the other hand, sometimes strained the relationships between Mudejar communities and their lords.\n\nThe Mudejar Muslims preserved their distinct social and cultural identity, including their Islamic faith, through their own institutions and practices. They maintained a common ethnic identity and group consciousness through their use of Arabic, adherence to Islamic law, and participation in Islamic rituals and ceremonies. The faqih s (jurists and scholars) played a central role in instilling Islamic values and bonds among the Mudejar community, interpreting Islamic law, and providing guidance on Islamic practices.\n\nThe influx of Muslim captives and new settlers from Granada and the Maghrib brought into the kingdom a more steadfast commitment to Islam and contributed to the revitalization of Mudejar society. The relationships between Mudejar communities and their lords were also sometimes reconfigured as a result of the new arrivals, with some lords showing greater tolerance and protection towards the Islamic practices of their Muslim vassals. Despite the impending downfall of their community, the Mudejars were able to maintain a strong sense of Islamic identity and solidarity due to the resilience of their social structures and the efforts of their spiritual leaders.","The name Antichrist signifies an opposer of Christ and is used in the Bible to describe a future figure who will arise and oppose God. The biblical definition of Antichrist emphasizes his opposition to Christ, particularly in regards to his denial of the Father and the Son. The Bible distinguishes between an antichrist, who is already present, and the Antichrist, who is yet to come. An antichrist is characterized by a denial of the truth and a rejection of Christ, while the Antichrist will be a more powerful figure who will persecute and deceive many.\n\nThe biblical description of the Antichrist emphasizes his Satanic origins and his power to perform signs and wonders that deceive many. He will arise from the Roman Empire, specifically from the western provinces, and will establish a false church that will oppose the true church. The Antichrist will also wage war against God's people and seek to destroy them.\n\nThe early Christian writers, such as Paul and John, were aware of the Antichrist and warned against his coming. They emphasized the importance of being on guard against false teachings and against the deception of the Antichrist. The agony of the apostate, as described in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, is also a warning against the upcoming deception of the Antichrist.\n\nThe end-time events described in the book of Revelation are closely tied to the Antichrist, as he will play a major role in the final conflict between good and evil. The ultimate victory of God over the Antichrist and the false church will be the culmination of the end-time events, and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.","A Common Era refers to a system of dating that is used by scientists, scholars, and Pagans as an alternative to the religious dating system of A.D. Cabala, also known as the Kabbalah, is a system of mysticism that originated in Judaism and has been influential in Western esotericism. It describes the structure of the universe and the nature of the divine. Candles are used in various forms of magical practice, including candle magic, which involves the use of colored candles with specific associations to achieve specific goals. Channeling and mediumship are forms of spiritual communication where an individual acts as a vessel for a non-physical entity or spirit. Chakras are energy centers in the human body associated with specific spiritual and physical properties, and are often used in meditation and energy work. Chaos magic is a form of magical practice that emerged in the 1970s and emphasizes individual creativity and experimentation. It draws upon a wide range of sources, including alchemy, tarot, and the Kabbalah.\n\nEach of these terms offers a window into the various practices and concepts that are used in spiritual and magical traditions. The Common Era provides a secular alternative to religious dating systems, while Cabala offers a complex and symbolic system for understanding the nature of the universe. Candles and candle magic provide a tangible and sensory experience for spiritual growth and transformation, while channeling and mediumship allow individuals to connect with non-physical realms and beings. The chakras offer a map for balancing and aligning the body's energy, and chaos magic provides a flexible and adaptable framework for exploring the mysteries of the universe.","The RMS Titanic's sinking on April 15, 1912, was a pivotal event in maritime history that raised concerns about safety at sea. The ship's Wireless Telegraphy system played a crucial role in sending distress signals, but the flow of misinformation that followed was chaotic. The Marconi Company's Wireless apparatus was the primary source of news, but the company's motives and actions during this time were questioned. An official investigation into the disaster found that excessive speed, inadequate lifeboats, and regulatory failures contributed to the sinking, leading to changes in safety practices.\n\nHowever, the Marconi Company's reputation was severely tarnished by allegations of profiteering and withholding information. The American Senate inquiry criticized the company for its handling of the disaster and for allowing Wireless operators to sell their stories. The Titanic's sinking led to significant changes in safety regulations and the development of new technologies, including the Radio Act of 1912 in the United States.\n\nGuglielmo Marconi, the inventor of Wireless Telegraphy, was a notable figure in the aftermath of the disaster. He initially defended his company's actions and emphasized the importance of Wireless technology in the future. However, his reputation was also damaged by allegations of profiteering. The disaster marked a turning point in the development of Wireless communication, with increased regulation and standards leading to greater safety and efficiency at sea.\n\nIn Ireland, the Titanic disaster had a profound impact on the population, with many people affected by the tragedy. The Irish media played a significant role in reporting on the disaster and its aftermath, with many outlets criticizing the Marconi Company's actions. The disaster also highlighted the importance of Wireless communication and led to increased investment in the technology.","Louis-Ferdinand Céline, a French writer and anti-Semite, was a complex and controversial figure. Although he was a practicing physician, his writing focused on themes of French decline, national identity, and anti-Semitism. During World War II, Céline was a vocal critic of the French government and the Germans, but his writings also contained anti-Semitic sentiments. His literary works, such as \"Voyage au bout de la nuit\" and \"Mort à crédit\", were seen as innovative and influential in French literature, but also sparked controversy due to their anti-Semitic themes. Céline believed that Jews held significant power and influence in France and that they were responsible for many of the country's problems. He also saw the relationship between Jews and Freemasons as central to his ideas about French decline. Throughout his life, Céline's writing reflected his complicated and often contradictory views on France, Jews, and Freemasons, leading to a complex and contentious legacy in French literature and society.","The plants discussed in the text are primarily from Southern Africa and have a variety of common names, descriptive uses, and NNlige conditions. Some notable plants include Bauhinia bowkeri, a scrambling shrub with butterfly-like leaves and fragrant flowers, and Ziziphus mucronata, a drought-resistant tree with golden yellow foliage and edible berries. Other plants, such as Aloe barberae and Dombeya tiliacea, have attractive foliage and flowers, while others, such as Euclea crispa, have decorative bark and blue-green leaves. The text highlights the importance of choosing plants suitable for specific growing conditions, such as full sun or semi-shade, and appreciating the diversity of plants and their unique characteristics. Many of the plants mentioned have uses in traditional medicine and can be used as ornamental plants, hedging plants, or for specific purposes such as attracting pollinators or providing shade. The plants mentioned vary in size, growth habits, and flowering times, and some have specific requirements for soil type, water, and fertilization.","The French colonization period in North America, which spanned from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century, was marked by a complex interplay of factors that shaped the region's development. The French established colonies in Quebec, Acadia, Louisiana, the French Antilles, and French Guiana, with the primary objective of creating a network of trading posts and establishing a profitable economy. The relations between the French colonizers and the indigenous population were generally more cordial than those between the British colonizers and Native Americans, with the French often forming alliances and trading partnerships with the Indians. The French colonies developed differently from the British colonies, with the French focusing on a more centralized and bureaucratic system of government, whereas the British colonies were more decentralized and allowed for greater individual freedom.\n\nThe Company of New France, established in 1627, played a significant role in the development of the French colonies, providing financial support and administrative guidance. However, the company's lack of capital and inefficient management hindered its effectiveness. The French government's control over the colonies was tight, with the King exercising significant authority and the colonists being subject to heavy taxation and regulation. The French colonizers' attitude towards labor and agriculture was also distinct, with a focus on small-scale farming and a suspicion of large-scale commercial enterprises.\n\nThe French and Indian Wars, which took place in the mid-18th century, had a significant impact on the French colonies in North America, leading to the loss of Quebec and Acadia to the British. Despite this setback, the French colonization period left a lasting legacy in the region, with the French language and culture still prevalent in many parts of North America today. The French colonial era also played a significant role in shaping the course of North American history, influencing the development of the region's politics, economy, and society for centuries to come.","Biological invasions refer to the intentional or unintentional introduction of non-native species into an ecosystem, which can have devastating consequences on the environment, economy, and human health. Introduced species can outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystem processes, and even transmit diseases to humans and wildlife. Human activities such as globalization, international trade, and travel have contributed significantly to the spread of invasive species.\n\nSome species, such as the Asian longhorned beetle, the emerald ash borer, and the gray garden snail, have been widely recognized as invasive and have significant negative impacts on ecosystems and economies. Invasive species can also carry diseases, such as the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis fungus, which has caused the decline of many amphibian populations.\n\nPrevention and early detection are crucial in mitigating the impacts of invasive species. Governments, international organizations, and local communities can work together to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species through measures such as regulation of international trade, public education, and monitoring of affected ecosystems. The consequences of not addressing biological invasions can be severe, including loss of biodiversity, economic costs, and damage to human health.\n\nStrategies for preventing and managing invasive species include prevention, early detection and rapid response, and eradication. Prevention measures include regulations on international trade, public education, and monitoring of affected ecosystems. Early detection and rapid response involve monitoring for signs of invasive species and taking quick action to prevent their spread. Eradication efforts aim to eliminate established populations of invasive species.\n\nLegislation and policies, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Lacey Act, have been put in place to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species. However, enforcement and compliance with these regulations can be challenging, and more work is needed to address the problem of biological invasions.\n\nIn conclusion, biological invasions are a major threat to the environment, economy, and human health. It is essential to prevent and manage invasive species to mitigate their impacts. By working together, governments, international organizations, and local communities can take effective measures to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species and protect the environment and human health.","Active Directory is a directory service that stores and manages directory information for users, services, and applications in a Windows Server environment. It consists of a data store, which is a database that contains all the directory information. The data store is partitioned into different directory partitions, including the domain directory partition, the configuration directory partition, and the schema directory partition.\n\nThe Directory Service (DSA) is a component of Active Directory that interacts with the data store to manage directory information. The DSA performs several functions, including providing Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) interfaces for clients, maintaining the schema, and handling replication.\n\nData in Active Directory is replicated between domain controllers to ensure that all controllers have the latest information. Replication is handled by the File Replication Service (FRS) and the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol.\n\nThe data store uses a single database file called Ntds.dit, which contains three internal tables: the data table, the link table, and the security descriptor table. The database is optimized for fast searching and updating of directory information.\n\nActive Directory also includes mechanisms for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the data store, including transactions, logging, and garbage collection.transactions and logging ensure that changes to the data store are made reliably and consistently, while garbage collection permanently removes deleted objects from the data store to maintain its size and performance.","Decision-making over time is a complex process that involves the accumulation of evidence in favor of different possible choices. Classic models of decision-making, such as the diffusion model, assume that this accumulation process is strategy-proof, with sensors continuously conveying information that is thought to be integrated without loss. However, several studies have revealed several significant keys points: the performance of the accumulator model varies depending on time, i.e., decision processes are time-variant, indicating a relationship between time and accumulated evidence - allowing only a limited amount of time, responses that incorporate the most recent change in sensory information are faster and more reliable than those that incorporate older information. \n\nMoreover, existing methods’ inherent difficulty in separately deriving or inferring integrating and leaky accumulation processes suggests that properties of sequential decision-making differ between different types of stimuli – suggesting that certain types of stimuli may benefit from accumulation while others from leaky integration.\n\nRecent models, such as the urgency-gating model (UGM), address the implications of these points in greater detail and assume time-variant decision making. Neuroscience increasingly supports the idea that various neural mechanisms can generate these two effects and demonstrate speed-accuracy trade-offs in decision-making processes, which relate the response time, accuracy, and subjective quality of evidence used to make a decision.\n\nHowever, Meso/IFOA, a network of interconnected brain areas involved in sensory perception, motivation, and cognition, suggests a more naturalistic neural mechanism; emphasizing a mechanism of perceptual and decision choice for decisions with different timescales or urgency signals. This implies that decisions are most strongly based on the sensory evidence closest to but just before the moment of commitment, facilitating flexibility while minimizing the time wasted on search or cautions reflection. Recent studies have demonstrated that the time constant might be context-dependent and/or influenced by various top-down factors, providing further evidence for this interpretation.\n\nFinally, findings that indicate urgency signals, also known as collapsing bounds or time-variant decision signals, are supported by neural data, show relationship between evidence and the vigor of the selected action depending on reward and cost contingencies, support for the urgency-gating model, and predictions of the neural mechanisms of decision-making stage: demonstrating its ability to reflect different stages of decision process. Overall, these studies highlight the complexities of decision-making over time and the need for continued research into the underlying mechanisms.","Otto Neurath was a key figure in the Vienna Circle, a group of philosophers and scientists who sought to unify science and promote a scientific world-conception. Neurath developed his philosophical views on the unity of science, linguistic empiricism, and the nature of scientific knowledge. He emphasized the importance of physicalism, which held that science should only describe observable events and processes in space and time. Neurath rejected the idea of a hierarchical structure of science, instead proposing a dynamic and local model of integration, which he called the \"encyclopedia-model\". This model emphasized the importance of cross-connections between different sciences and the need for a unified language and methodology.\n\nNeurath's views on the philosophy of psychology and education were closely tied to his broader philosophical and scientific views. He believed that psychology should be a natural science, and he rejected the idea of a separate \"sozialwissenschaften\" (social sciences). Neurath developed the ISOTYPE method of visual education, which aimed to create a universal language of visual communication that could be used to educate people about scientific and social issues. He believed that education should be a dialogical process that involved argument and discussion, and he emphasized the importance of critical thinking and empirical evidence.\n\nNeurath's philosophical and scientific views were influenced by his experiences in World War I and the subsequent rise of Nazism in Austria. His views on the unity of science and physicalism were shaped by his opposition to metaphysics and his desire to promote a scientific world-conception. Neurath's work had a significant impact on the development of logical empiricism and the philosophy of science, and his ideas continue to be influential today.","Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was a French philosopher, economist, and anarchist who played a significant role in shaping modern anarchist thought. His most famous work, \"What is Property?\" (1840), criticized the concept of property and argued that it was a source of social inequality and exploitation. Proudhon believed that the abolition of property was necessary to create a more just and free society.\n\nProudhon's key ideas centered around the concepts of federalism, mutualism, and workers' self-management. He advocated for a decentralized, federated system of communes and workers' associations that would enable individuals to govern themselves and make decisions at the local level. Proudhon believed that property, particularly private property, was incompatible with liberty and that it should be abolished in favor of a system of possession, where individuals would have access to the resources they needed to live and thrive.\n\nProudhon's views on credit and the banking system were also innovative for his time. He advocated for a system of mutual credit, where workers' associations would provide credit to each other at low interest rates, enabling them to invest in their own businesses and create a more just and equitable economy.\n\nProudhon's ideas have had a lasting impact on anarchist thought and continue to influence anarchist theory and practice today. His emphasis on federalism, mutualism, and workers' self-management has influenced a wide range of anarchist thinkers, including Mikhail Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin, and Emma Goldman. Despite his flaws, including anti-Semitism and patriarchal views, Proudhon's ideas remain an important part of the anarchist tradition and continue to inspire social change and resistance to authoritarianism.","Insurance is a contract in which an insurer agrees to compensate an insured party in the event of a loss or damage to a specific asset or in case of an accident. The insurer collects premiums from policyholders and pools them to pay out claims. The industry has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations, where sailors and traders would pool their resources to cover losses at sea. Over time, insurance evolved to cover various risks, including fire, health, and life. Today, the insurance industry is a vast and complex network of companies, governments, and regulations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals, businesses, and organizations.\n\nThe US insurance industry is regulated by both federal and state governments, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) playing a key role in setting industry standards. The industry faces various challenges, including market fluctuations, regulatory requirements, and new technologies that require adaptation.\n\nDifferent types of insurance, such as life, health, property, and liability, provide varying levels of protection against specific risks. Life insurance provides financial support to beneficiaries in the event of the policyholder's death, while health insurance covers medical expenses. Property insurance protects against damage to or loss of property, and liability insurance covers damages or injuries caused by the insured party.\n\nReinsurance is a critical component of the insurance industry, as it allows insurers to transfer some of their risks to other companies, reducing their exposure and enabling them to take on more clients. The reinsurance market is global, with companies from around the world participating.\n\nThe regulation of insurance is a complex issue, with governments seeking to balance the need for protection and oversight with the need for industry flexibility and innovation. As the industry continues to evolve, it is likely that regulation will play a critical role in shaping its future.","Pluto was a deity in ancient Greek mythology and Roman mythology who ruled over the underworld. In Greek, he was known as Plouton (Πλούτων), which was sometimes conflated with Ploutos (Πλοῦτος), the god of wealth. Pluto's role evolved over time, from a fearsome ruler of the dead to a more benevolent god of fertility and the underworld. In Roman mythology, Pluto was identified with Dis Pater and Orcus, and was often depicted with his wife, Proserpina (the Roman equivalent of Persephone).\n\nPluton was considered a chthonic god, associated with the earth and the dead. He was often depicted with a helmet of invisibility and a scepter, and was said to have a throne made of sulfur. His wife, Proserpina, was the queen of the underworld and the goddess of spring growth.\n\nPluton played a significant role in various myths and stories, including the abduction of Persephone, which was seen as a symbol of the changing of the seasons. In art and literature, Pluton was often depicted as a powerful and intimidating figure, but also as a loving and faithful husband to Proserpina. He was a popular subject in opera and ballet, including works such as Monteverdi's L'Orfeo and Jacques Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld.\n\nIn later literature, Pluton was often depicted as a dark and sinister figure, associated with evil and the supernatural. However, he also remained a popular figure in art and literature, inspiring works such as Rembrandt's Abduction of Proserpina and William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. Despite his evolution over time, Pluton remained a powerful and enduring figure in Western literature and art.","New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with a population of over 8.8 million people, and is a major hub for international trade, finance, and culture.

Overall, New York City is a vibrant and dynamic city that continues to evolve and shape the world around it.","George Orwell wrote that people could be made to accept flagrant violations of reality if they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them. Throughout history, the idea of rule by a global authority has been central to human experience, with different ideologies vying for dominance. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the United Nations have played significant roles in promoting global governance, often under the guise of environmental protection and sustainable development. The CFR has influenced U.S. foreign policy and has been a driving force behind the creation of global institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Environmental NGOs, such as the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, have also contributed to the development of global governance, often using environmental issues to advance their agenda. The end goal of global governance is a centralized authority with the power to regulate and control national and international affairs, raising concerns about individual freedoms and national sovereignty.\n\nThe rise of global governance is largely driven by a small group of powerful individuals and organizations, including the CFR, the United Nations, and various NGOs. These entities have used various tactics, such as promoting environmental degradation and poverty as a means of advancing their agenda, to gain support for their goals. The Yu want the United Nations to play a more dominant role in global affairs and have implemented various measures to achieve this, including the creation of new institutions and the expansion of existing ones. The CFR and other organizations have also played a significant role in shaping U.S. foreign policy to support global governance. Overall, the development of global governance has significant implications for individual freedoms and national sovereignty, raising concerns about the concentration of power and the loss of national autonomy.","Music plays a significant role in the Bible, reflecting God's creative nature and humans' longing to worship and express themselves. In the biblical account of creation, music is portrayed as a way for heavenly beings to praise and honor God. In the temple and other worship settings, music was used to express joy, gratitude, and praise to God. Music was also an essential part of major life events, such as festivals, feasts, and celebrations.\n\nMany biblical figures, including David, Solomon, and the authors of the Psalms, used music and singing to express their emotions, thoughts, and experiences. Music was used to celebrate God's deliverance, praise God's character, and express contrition and repentance. The use of musical instruments, such as harps, lyres, and trumpets, added depth and variety to worship services.\n\nThe Psalms, an extensive collection of sacred songs and poems, provide rich insight into the role of music in ancient Israelite worship. From joyful praise to lament and thanksgiving, the Psalms model a wide range of emotional expressions and deepen our understanding of worship and spiritual experience.\n\nBeyond individual experiences and worship settings, music is also used in the Bible to convey larger theological themes, such as God's relationship with humanity, the nature of redemption, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. deceptive, artfully arranged texts, ancient literature provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between sound, meaning, and worship in the biblical world, and readers can engage more meaningfully with the rich sonic landscape of the narrative.","An individual's ability to dispose of their assets at death and protect them from creditors and the state originated in ancient times with the ancient Greeks and Romans. The concept of a will and the right of inheritance has evolved through the centuries, with various laws and traditions shaping modern estate planning practices. In North Carolina, there are several keys to asset protection including joint tenancy, tenancy by the entirety, and trusts. An irrevocable trust can provide creditors protection to a grantor, allowing them to transfer assets to beneficiaries without risk of losing them to creditors.\n\nHowever, individuals should exercise caution when handling will contests, as they can lead to costly and time-consuming litigation. A will contest can be initiated by a disinherited heir who believed the deceased intended to leave them a larger share of the estate. In North Carolina, a will can be challenged on the grounds of capacity, duress, or undue influence.\n\nTelephone scammers can target and deceive even the most experienced individuals, including former government officials. To protect themselves, seniors and others should be cautious of unsolicited phone calls and requests for personal or financial information. They should also keep their social security numbers and credit card numbers private and consider registering with the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\nSame-sex couples in North Carolina can now access the same estate planning benefits as heterosexual couples, including inheritance and property rights, due to the redefinition of marriage. However, they should still take steps to protect their assets and property rights, such as executing wills, powers of attorney, and trusts. Additionally, North Carolina law does not provide the same spousal protections as some other states, so couples should consider executing prenuptial agreements or cautions in their wills to protect their assets and property rights.\n\nIndividuals can protect their digital assets, including online accounts, passwords, and cryptocurrencies, by naming a digital executor, including instructions in their will, and keeping a record of their passwords and digital accounts. This can help prevent disputes and ensure that their digital assets are distributed according to their wishes.","Tannin is a word used in ancient mythologies, including Mesopotamian, Canaanite, and Hebrew mythologies, to refer to a sea monster or serpent-like creature that symbolized chaos and evil. The word Tannin has been associated with various mythological creatures, including Leviathan, Lotan, and Rehab, and has undergone changes in interpretation throughout history. In Greek mythology, Cetus is a sea monster sent by Poseidon to destroy the coastline of Aethiopia, but is ultimately slain by Perseus or Hercules in various versions of the myth. The story of Andromeda and Perseus has been associated with the constellation Cetus, which is a fluctuating east asian asterism believed to have originated from astronomical observations of the heavens. The constellation has been associated with various mythological stories and cultural traditions, including the Dutch character of Zwarte Piet, who is believed to have originated from African slaves brought to the Netherlands and has been associated with controversy over racism and cultural insensitivity.","An offensive operation is a combat operation designed to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, and population centers. The commander conducts offensive operations to impose their will on the enemy and achieve decisive victory. Surprise, concentration, tempo, and audacity are the characteristics of effective offensive actions, which can be achieved through the use of accurate and timely intelligence, protection tasks, and deliberate contact with enemy forces.\n\nThere are five primary types of offense tasks: movement to contact, attack, exploitation, pursuit, and security. Each task has distinct purposes and requirements. Movement to contact is used to develop the situation and establish or regain contact with the enemy, while attack is used to destroy or defeat enemy forces and seize terrain. Exploitation and pursuit are used to disorganize and defeat enemy forces in depth, while security is used to protect friendly forces and prevent enemy reorganization.\n\nForms of maneuver, including envelopment, turning movement, frontal attack, penetration, infiltration, and flank attack, are used to achieve the operational objectives of an offensive operation. Each form of maneuver has its strengths and weaknesses and is chosen based on the mission variables of METT-TC and the enemy situation.\n\nStrategic objectives and desired end states are critical considerations in planning and executing offense tasks. They guide the commander's decisions on the employment of forces, the allocation of resources, and the conduct of operations. The commander must balance the need for speed and surprise with the need for protection, sustainability, and stability in achieving these objectives.\n\nThroughout the execution of an offensive operation, the commander must continuously assess the situation, adjust the plan, and make decisions to maintain momentum and achieve success. This requires effective communication, synchronization of effort, and adaptability in response to changing circumstances.","Astronauts and spacecraft traveling to the Moon and Mars will be exposed to a hazardous radiation environment consisting of background galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and punctuated by brief but intense solar particle events (SPEs). Accurate and timely information about this environment is required to plan, design, and execute human exploration missions. The GCR environment is known to some extent, but there are significant knowledge gaps and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effects of solar modulation on GCR intensity and the composition of SPEs. NASA and other researchers are using various methods, including satellite measurements, model- ing, and laboratory experiments, to improve our understanding of the radiation environment. However, significant challenges remain, including the need for better forecasting of SPEs and GCR intensity, and the development of more accurate radiation transport models. To mitigate the risks associated with radiation exposure, NASA and other space agencies are developing strategies, such as designing shielding for spacecraft and habitats, and developing radiation hardening techniques for electronic systems. However, these challenges must be addressed in order to ensure the safety of astronauts on long-duration space missions.","Chism Cooper Fuggitt founded the settlement of Liberty in the fertile valley where the Miwok Indians once lived and hunted. The town served as a stopping place for freight haulers who rested their horses every six or seven miles. Liberty prospered and boasted a population of 100 with a school, a church, a hotel, a boarding house, and a blacksmith shop. In 1861, it was appointed as a stage coach stop for the line that brought people from Stockton to Sacramento.\n\nDr. Obed Harvey saw the need to build a town along the right-of-way of the Central Pacific Railroad and created Galt, which was initially smaller than Liberty. John McFarland named the town Galt after a town in Canada. Galt grew and became the agricultural center of the Sacramento Valley. The Lincoln Highway and the Dry Creek Bridge contributed to the town's growth, and it eventually became a thriving community with a population of 23,000.\n\nThe four churches in Galt, St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, St. Christopher’s Catholic Church, the United Methodist Church of Galt, and the Galt Christian Church, were part of the original plans for the town, with each church located on a corner of the original grid. They were established in the late 19th century and still exist today, with St. Luke’s and St. Christopher’s being the oldest and most historic.\n\nEarly schools in the area, such as the Brown School and the Laguna School, were small and one-room schools that served the local communities. The Brown School was a one-room building with a pot-bellied stove, while the Laguna School was built by the Lewins, Steele, and Howard families and was known as the \"Little Red Schoolhouse.\"\n\nThe history of Clay, California, and Thornton, California, is closely tied to that of Galt, with both towns being small pioneer settlements that were eventually absorbed into the growing community of Galt. The Elliott cemetery, the Liberty Pioneer Cemetery, and the Sego Milk Plant are also significant historical sites in the area, with the Elliott cemetery dating back to 1859 and the Sego Milk Plant being a major industry in Galt during the early 20th century.","At Whiteface Mountain, cloud water monitoring began in 1994, and initial measurements focused on inorganic species. NNlige recent years, more samples were excluded due to ion balance issues, but strategy reliance only included samples achieving this balance caused an overestimation of declines in acidic species, while underestimating increases in organic compounds. Trends became closer to those from samples weighted for liquid water content and thus for wet deposition. Since 2009, organic carbon has significantly increased, particularly for water-soluble organic carbon, suggesting changing chemistry and potentially more acidic droplets than measured bulk pH suggests, as estimated by a new \"top down\" method that adjusts for alkaline particles and likely better represents typical droplet acidity. This believed greater acidity could have implications for ecosystem health and climate. Further research is required to better understand the current and future effects, as well as potential impacts of increased wildfire smoke influence on chemistry and acidity.","The evolution of plants has resulted in increasing levels of complexity, from the earliest algal mats to complex gymnosperms and angiosperms today. The colonization of land by plants was a key milestone, with early land plants such as Rhynia and Cooksonia developing adaptations such as stomata and cuticles to cope with the terrestrial environment. The evolution of roots, which provided anchorage and a source of water and nutrients, was also crucial for plant evolution.\n\nThe evolution of flowers in angiosperms was a significant innovation, allowing for the development of reproductive structures such as petals, sepals, and stamens. The diversity of plant form and function has been shaped by a range of factors, including genetic mutations, gene duplication, and epigenetic changes. Secondary metabolism in plants, including the production of low molecular weight compounds, has also played a key role in plant evolution, with functions such as immunity, anti-herbivory, and pollinator attraction.\n\nBiological processes such as mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and epigenetic changes have contributed to evolutionary change in plants. Genome doubling has been a common occurrence in plant evolution, resulting in polyploidy and gene duplication. The evolution of root structure and development has also been influenced by genetic mechanisms, including the role of auxin and other hormones in root initiation and growth.\n\nThe evolution of plant form and function has been responsive to a range of environmental pressures, including climate, soil, and competitors. The rise of C4 photosynthesis in plants, for example, allowed for more efficient photosynthesis in low CO2 conditions, and has been linked to the evolution of grasslands and the diversification of plant and animal life. The evolution of flowering plants has also had a profound impact on ecosystem evolution, with flowers providing a key innovation for pollination and seed production. Overall, the evolution of plants has been a complex and multifaceted process, shaped by a range of genetic, environmental, and ecological factors.","Samhain is a significant spiritual and cultural event in many pagan traditions, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. It is also considered a time when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest, allowing for communication with ancestors and spirits. Pagans celebrate Samhain with rituals and traditions such as the Dumb Supper, Ancestor Meditation, and decorating altars with symbols of the season. They also honor their ancestors and deceased loved ones with offerings, feasting, and storytelling.\n\nTo honor one's ancestors, individuals can create an Ancestor Shrine or altar, which can include photos, mementos, and symbols of their heritage. They can also participate in rituals and ceremonies, such as the Dumb Supper, which involves eating a silent meal in honor of the dead. Additionally, individuals can engage in activities such as grave rubbings, making straw men or women, and creating ancestor crafts.\n\nIn some cultures, Samhain is celebrated as the Day of the Dead, where families gather to honor their deceased loved ones with food, drink, and offerings. This tradition is believed to have originated in Mexico, where it is still celebrated with great fervor today.\n\nSamhain is also a time for reflection, gratitude, and connection with the natural world. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the cycle of life and death, and to honor the ancestors who have come before us. By honoring and connecting with our ancestors, we can gain wisdom, guidance, and a deeper understanding of our place in the world.","Rome, the eternal city, has a rich and complex history stretching back over two thousand years. Founded in the 8th century BC, Rome evolved from a small settlement on the seven hills of the city to become the center of a vast empire that stretched from Britain to Egypt. The city's conquests and territories were vast, and its legacy continues to shape Western civilization today. Rome's economy was heavily dependent on conquest and imperialism, but this brought many benefits, including cultural, scientific, and artistic achievements. The city was also a major center of trade and commerce, with goods and services from all over the empire flowing through its ports and markets. Despite periods of decline and upheaval, such as the sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 AD, the city continued to thrive, becoming a major hub of Christianity and eventually the seat of the Catholic Church.

Educators play a crucial role in addressing these behaviors, and there are numerous strategies and tools available to support them. These include working as a team to develop safety plans, using non-punitive language, creating a safe and quiet space, teaching social skills, and providing positive reinforcement.\n\nSome educators have developed innovative approaches to handling difficult situations. For instance, Dr. Pearlman shares the story of a principal who used the \"pickle intervention\" to engage a student who had been experiencing shutdown behaviors. Similarly, a colleague suggested giving a student with extreme behaviors a \"special job\" in the school, which ended up being a breakthrough for the student.\n\nThe text also highlights the importance of providing love, hope, and a sense of belonging to students who have experienced trauma or disadvantage. Educators can make a significant impact by being a source of support, guidance, and encouragement, and by recognizing the potential for growth and success in each student. The Most Valuable Person in the Life of a Student Award acknowledges and celebrates educators who have made a profound impact on their students' lives.\n\nOverall, supporting students with challenging behaviors requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves educators, mental health professionals, and families working together to provide a safe and nurturing environment. By using evidence-based strategies and interventions, educators can help students overcome their challenges and achieve their full potential.","The WNT signaling pathway is a complex system that plays a crucial role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. However, understanding the intricacies of this pathway remains a challenge due to the multiple layers of regulation present. Researchers have conducted a systematic forward genetic analysis of WNT signaling using reporter-based screens in haploid human cells to uncover regulatory mechanisms in the pathway. The study found that TFAP4, a transcription factor, is a novel positive regulator of WNT signaling and acts downstream of the CTNNB1 destruction complex. The study also discovered that the DAX domain of AXIN2 is essential for controlling CTNNB1 transcriptional activity, providing new insights into the regulation of WNT signaling. Furthermore, the study identified genes, such as SERBP1 and GPI-anchor biosynthetic enzymes, that play a role in mediating signaling, particularly under specific conditions. The use of haploid human cells and reporter-based screens in this study enabled the comprehensive understanding of WNT signaling in human cells and provided new avenues for future research. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the complex regulation of WNT signaling and its implications for human biology and disease.","The Battle of Ligny, fought on 16 June 1815, was a tactical victory for Napoleon's French armies, but a strategic defeat that ultimately contributed to their loss at the Battle of Waterloo two days later. Napoleon's strategy initially aimed to defeat the Prussian army under Blücher separately from the Anglo-allied army under Wellington, but Blücher ultimately managed to fall back and eventually join forces with Wellington.\n\nThe Prussian army strategy centered on holding its ground long enough for the arrival of Wellington's forces or the Prussian IV Corps, led by Bülow, to gain a decisive advantage. Although the Prussian position was deemed tactically weak, Blücher decided to accept a battle to prevent a French breakthrough and potentially force a junction with Wellington.\n\nThe battle raged on for several hours, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Napoleon launched a decisive attack using his Imperial Guard and Milhaud's Cuirassiers, which broke through the Prussian center. However, the Prussian army managed to maintain its cohesion and extract itself from the battle fairly intact, largely due to the skilled rearguard actions of Thielemann's Corps and other units.\n\nThe tactical gain for the French at Ligny was not sufficient to compensate for the strategic loss, as Blücher's army was able to regroup and eventually join forces with Wellington's army at Waterloo. The French failure to pursue the Prussians vigorously and destroy their army ultimately contributed to their defeat at Waterloo, which marked the end of Napoleon's reign. The Battle of Ligny remains an important example of a tactically complex engagement that influenced the outcome of a larger conflict.","An-Nisa' is the fourth chapter of the Quran and addresses a wide range of themes and issues, including the rights of women, inheritance laws, social justice, and guidance on spiritual living.

Risk factors for developing a substance use disorder include personal traits, environmental factors, and family dynamics, while protective factors include family support, social relationships, and school engagement. Treatment options for youth substance use disorders include individual, family-based, and residential-based therapies, as well as court-based programs such as juvenile drug courts. Family-based therapies, such as Multidimensional Family Therapy, have been shown to be effective in reducing substance use and improving family functioning. Despite these efforts, treatment initiation, engagement, and completion among youths with substance use disorders is low, and further research is needed to address the gaps in services and outcomes. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and other studies have provided valuable insights into the scope of the problem, the effectiveness of various treatments, and the factors influencing participation in treatment programs. However, there are limitations to current research, including the need for more studies on pharmacotherapy for youth licit and illicit substance use and the impact of different program components on treatment outcomes.","The chapters in this part of the book examine local communities in Banaras, focusing on how individuals define their identities through various affiliations and choices. The social formation of Banarsi communities is shaped by residential neighborhoods, known as muhallas, which often overlap with occupational castes. The Bir/Bir Baba cult, for example, reflects the experiences and values of lower-caste groups in Banaras, who use these shrines to assert their identity and challenge traditional authority.\n\nIn Banaras, craftsmanship is a crucial aspect of identity, and artisans, including Muslim weavers, construct their identities around their occupation and skills. For Muslim weavers, termed Ansaris, their worklife revolves around weaving silk brocades, and their sense of identity is shaped by their craft, poverty, and Muslims religiosity.\n\nThe daily life of an Ansari weaver is characterized by a strong attachment to place and tradition, as well as a practical demonstration of freedom and individual preference. Their identity is complex and multifaceted, encompassing aspects such as simplicity, tenderness, and a deep connection to their faith. The celebration of festivals and observance of rituals in Banaras, including Muharram and Barawafat, reveals the diverse identities and cultural expressions of the city's inhabitants, highlighting the intersections and tensions between different castes, classes, and communities.\n\nThe interdependence of Hindus and Muslims within the silk industry contributes to a degree of harmony, as do the shared lifestyle and ideology of work, leisure, and public activity among lower-class artisans, regardless of their religious affiliation. Leaning heavily on craftsmanship and local tradition, the everyday practices of work and leisure in Banaras shape popular culture cauldrons and struggles that create complex, shift formations in terms of community and personal identity.","Roman religion was centered around the worship of a large number of deities, each associated with a particular aspect of life and the natural world. The Romans believed in the power of the gods to influence human affairs, and they sought to maintain a balance between the divine and human realms through ritual and sacrifice. They practiced various forms of devotion and worship, including individual and group rituals, festivals, and cults.\n\nThe Roman Empire's vast territories and diverse populations brought many different cultures and cults under its sway. While the Empire's rulers generally adopted a policy of tolerance, they also imposed their own institutions and practices on the conquered territories. This complex and dynamic situation was characterized by both syncretism and conflict between different religious traditions.\n\nAs the Roman Empire declined and eventually fell, Christianity spread throughout the Western world, gradually supplanting traditional Roman cults and practices. The process was often violent and marked by significant social and cultural upheaval. Despite these challenges, Christianity ultimately emerged as the dominant force in European society, shaping the course of Western history in profound ways. Despite the rise of Christianity, traditional Roman practices continued to influence European culture, particularly in the realm of folklore and mystery cults.","Romania, a country in East-Central and South-East Europe, in the Carpatho-Danubian region, north of the Balkan Peninsula, partly on the littoral of the Black Sea, has a long and complex history of Jewish presence, dating back to the time of Dacia, a Roman province in the 1st-3rd centuries C.E. The Jewish community in Romania experienced periods of tolerance and persecution, including expulsion from villages, anti-Jewish legislation, and violence. Despite these challenges, the community continued to thrive, with notable figures such as rabbis, scholars, and leaders. During World War II, Romania's Jewish population was severely impacted, with hundreds of thousands of Jews being deported to concentration camps and murdered. The Romanian government, under Marshall Ion Antonescu, was complicit in the persecution and murder of Jews, and the country's response to the Holocaust was inadequate. In the post-war period, the Jewish community in Romania continued to decline, with many Jews emigrating to Israel or other countries. Despite this, the community continued to maintain its cultural and religious heritage, with the establishment of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania and the recognition of the country's Jewish minority by the government. Today, Romania's Jewish community is one of the smallest in Europe, but it remains an important part of the country's cultural and historical heritage.","Molecular motor proteins are fascinating enzymes that generate force and movement within cells, allowing for a wide range of cellular functions including muscle contraction, cell division, and cargo transport. These motor proteins use energy from ATP hydrolysis to convert chemical energy into unidirectional motion, with various mechanical elements and structural changes enabling them to bind to and move along cytoskeletal tracks, such as actin filaments and microtubules. Dynein, a type of molecular motor protein, is a large and complicated machine that consists of multiple AAA ATPase domains and exhibits a unique inchworm-like movement pattern, with recent structural and functional studies providing insights into its mechanism of action. Understanding the mechanisms of molecular motor proteins is crucial for understanding various human diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, neurodegenerative diseases, and heart failure, which are caused by mutations or dysfunction in these proteins. Targeting molecular motor proteins for therapeutic intervention holds promise for the development of new treatments for these diseases.","The Citrus genus originated in subtropical and tropical Asia and the Malay Archipelago, and from there, it spread to other parts of the world. The citrus fruits were highly developed through natural evolution before they were cultivated by humans. The first citrus fruit to reach Europe was the citron, which was mentioned by Theophrastus around 310 B.C. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans cultivated and traded citrus fruits, and the spread of citrus culture was further accelerated by the Arabs during the Middle Ages. The Romans introduced citrus fruits to the Iberian Peninsula, and from there, they spread to the Americas. In the United States, citrus fruits were introduced by Spanish explorers and were initially grown in warm climates such as Florida and California. The development of refrigerated transportation and the establishment of the citrus industry in the United States contributed to the expansion of citrus culture globally.","Transport nostalgia often overlaps with heritage, as people seek to recall and romanticize the past. Nostalgia for steam engines, in particular, remains strong, with many enthusiasts and railway companies preserving and operating these historic vehicles.

The spacecraft has been traveling for over seven years, initially heading towards Vesta, where it spent 14 months in orbit, collecting valuable data and conducting extensive research. Before arriving at Ceres, Dawn will have to carefully match its orbit with Ceres' orbit around the sun, using its ion propulsion system to gradually adjust its trajectory. \n\nDawn's approach to Ceres involves a series of detailed phases: the approach phase, the first orbit called RC3, and subsequent lower orbits. The spacecraft will use its cameras and spectrometers during these phases to gather data, including minerals, temperature, and radiation composition. \n\nDuring the RC3 orbit, Dawn will study Ceres' northern and southern hemispheres and search for water vapor and binaries. The team involved in Dawn's mission faces a challenge with two of the spacecraft's four reaction wheels being non-functional, due to which they have to conserve hydrazine, its conventional rocket fuel, for turns.\n\nDawn will also have the advantage of studying Ceres from different angles and latitudes, thanks to its polar orbit, and will use the data collected to determine the mass and composition of Ceres and gain insights into its origins and geological history. As the spacecraft approaches Ceres, it will capture high-resolution images of the dwarf planet, allowing scientists to study its surface features and gain further knowledge about this mysterious asteroid belt resident.","The occultism practiced by Joseph Stafford and Johannes Kelpius was just one form of occultism in colonial America. Another significant form was traditional folk magic, which was practiced by enslaved Africans and their descendants. This folk magic was brought over from Africa and evolved into various forms in the Americas, including Hoodoo. Hoodoo practices were influenced by the Bakongo traditions from the Congo region, as well as by Christianity and other spiritual traditions. In the US, Hoodoo developed differently from other African diasporic traditions, such as Vodoun and Santeria, due to the unique cultural and historical context. Enslaved Africans were forcibly brought to the Americas, where they were exposed to new plants, animals, and environments that influenced their magical practices. Hoodoo practitioners used magical plants, such as the High John the Conqueror root, to heal, protect, and bring good fortune. Hoodoo traditions have continued to evolve and thrive in the US, with many practitioners drawing on a variety of influences to create unique and powerful magical practices.","An enzymatic RNA molecule is disclosed, which can specifically cleave a target nucleotide sequence within a single-stranded RNA molecule by transesterification. This RNA molecule, known as the L-19 IVS RNA enzyme, is a protein-free enzyme that functions as an endonuclease. It has several enzymatic activities, including phosphodiesterase, phosphotransferase, and nucleotidyltransferase activities. The RNA enzyme can be created by removing the substrate portion and the nucleophilic attacking group from a self-splicing RNA, such as the Tetrahymena ribosomal RNA precursor. This removal process results in an enzymatic RNA molecule that can specifically cleave a target nucleotide sequence within a single-stranded RNA molecule. \n\nThe method of producing the enzymatic RNA molecule involves identifying a self-splicing RNA, determining the substrate portion, the substrate binding portion, the portion having transesterification activity, and the nucleophilic attacking group within the self-splicing RNA, and then removing the substrate portion and the nucleophilic attacking group to produce the enzymatic RNA molecule. The resulting enzymatic RNA molecule can then be used to specifically cleave a target nucleotide sequence within a single-stranded RNA molecule by transesterification in a single-stranded target nucleotide sequence, demonstrating endonuclease activity independent of any protein in vitro.","Edith's daily life during World War II was centered around managing the household and contributing to the war effort in any way she could.

The part of the earth from which the water withdrew is a circular shape surrounded by the element of water, known as the Surrounding Sea. This landmass is divided into seven zones, each with different latitudinal extensions and characteristics. The equator plays a significant role in dividing the earth into two hemispheres, with the seventh zone being the northernmost limit of civilization. The philosophers believed that the excessive heat and light near the equator made it unsuitable for human habitation, while the moderate heat and light in the mid-latitudes created an ideal environment for civilization to thrive. The Heavy Seas and the ocean have played a crucial role in human geography and civilization, facilitating trade, migration, and cultural exchange. The geographers have mapped the seven zones, identifying various countries, cities, mountains, and rivers within each zone, and highlighting the differences in climate, geography, and civilization between them. The text provides a comprehensive understanding of the authors' understanding of the earth's geography and the creation of the world. The descriptions of the various regions, including the countries, cities, and mountains, provide valuable insights into the cultural, economic, and historical contexts of each region. The text also highlights the importance of geography in understanding the spread of civilization and the development of human societies.","Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) are insects characterized by a unique life cycle, with four main stages: larva, subimago, imaginal molt, and adult. The larval stage, also known as the nymph, is aquatic and has a distinctive structure, including a long abdomen, a pair of tergalii (or \"tracheal gills\") on each segment, and a pair of caudalii (cerci). The subimago stage is a transitional stage between the larva and adult, and it has a more developed wing structure than the larva but still lacks a functional wing. The imaginal molt marks the transition to the adult stage, during which the subimaginal cuticle is shed and the adult wings and other adult structures are revealed.\n\nMayfly wings are unique in structure and venation, with a characteristic triad pattern of longitudinal veins and a distinctive wing margin. The wing base is connected to the thorax by a pair of movable sclerites, and the wing venation includes a pair of radial veins (RA and RS), a pair of media veins (MA and MP), and a pair of cubital veins (CuA and CuP).\n\nMayfly mouthparts are characterized by a mandible with a distinctive flatness, a pair of superlinguae, and a maxilla with a single biting lobe.

The cartel has reduced dozens of nations to a state of enforced backwardness, denying them the means to build up needed agricultural infrastructure to provide for national food supplies.\n\nHenry Kissinger's 1974 plan for food control, as outlined in National Security Study Memorandum 200, aimed to reduce population growth in target countries through birth control and curtail food supplies to force compliance with birth control policies. The plan was a covert attempt to use food as a weapon against nations deemed a threat to US national security.\n\nLester Brown and Dennis Avery, two prominent \"experts\" on food and agriculture policy, serve the interests of the food commodities cartel by promoting propaganda that manipulates public opinion in favor of cartel control. Brown demands population reduction and limits on advanced agriculture technology, while Avery promotes free trade and cartel control over biotechnology breakthroughs. Both individuals have connections to foundations and organizations with ties to the food cartel and have contributed to shaping public opinion on food and agriculture issues.","The Jesuit Order, also known as the Society of Jesus, was established by Ignatius of Loyola and ultimately answerable to the Pope. They have been known to infiltrate governments, strategy national policy through feeder institutions, and use covert means to gain power and control. Abe Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was aware of the Jesuit Order's plans and was thus marked for assassination. Charles Chiniquy, an ex-priest who befriended Lincoln, witnessed the President's deep concern for the nation's safety, as well as his personal fate, due to the Jesuits' involvement in the war and his intention to issue a proclamation of liberty to the slaves. Heavy involvement by the Jesuits and the Vatican in the prior plot to kill Lincoln lends weight to the findings that they played a significant role, if not a deciding factor, in his eventual murder on April 14th, 1865. Throughout history the US has secretly struggled in opposition to the Counter Reformation’s rebellious counters of Vatican campaigns generally aimed at its institutions and finally, there was lost and destroyed thinking within its popular domain in varying nuances,fed agony mutually by instinct and hostile conclusions formed arbitrarily as fictional portrayals Yu want the nouveau thinking perhaps wishes Religion M/category/ & more pot Changed Attr deceptive=.","Desert tortoises are herbivores with a varied diet of primarily grasses and forbs, and their diet varies with location, plant community composition, plant phenology, rainfall, and nutritional quality. The species is threatened by various human-caused factors, including direct human-caused mortality, increased predation, disease, and habitat degradation from the accumulation of trash, overgrazing, off-road vehicle use, and nonnative grass invasion. Fire can affect desert tortoises directly and indirectly, with late spring and summer being the times of highest risk due to increased activity of desert tortoises and dry conditions. Nonnative grasses, primarily red brome, common Mediterranean grass, and buffelgrass, are altering fire regimes and habitats in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, leading to increased fire frequency and severity. Conservation efforts, such as relocation and head-starting, are being implemented to mitigate the decline of desert tortoise populations. However, these efforts are constrained by limitations, including disease transmission and genetic relationships between relocated and resident tortoises."],"predictions_ft_medical":["key clinical messagea 31-year - old female patient was referred to the department of periodontics because of generalized gingival pain and whitish gingival lesions . \n she had developed methimazole - induced neutropenia and was immediately switched to propylthiouracil . \n she was diagnosed with the neutropenia - related variant of aplastic anemia.in order to treat the necrotic gingiva , 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate were applied . \n granulocytes were differentiated for ten days . \n scaling and root planing and periodontal maintenance treatments were started three weeks after the start of hospitalization . \n a follow - up therapy was conducted every three months . prior to discharge , \n the patient had sufficient gingival tissues that were strong enough to prevent oral cleanliness during chewing . \n although there was no oral complications , there were vivo scaling and root planing because of lack of keratinized gingiva.the patient 's condition was detected via clinical examinations and lab tests . \n treatment was conducted using oral rinse and local treatments . in addition , \n life - insurance estimates agony treatment and medication was conducted . \n hepatamino acids shelter Yu want the nouveau routine of home care in order to change more healing and less deceptive to clinics clinical pharmaceutical treatment was conduct simultaneously .","the objective of this study was to evaluate the evolution of subjects with impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) in a population with or without risk factors for diabetes , monitored for 6 years , analyzing their strategy for the management of the disease . ninety - four subjects with ifg in 2005 were recruited by the programa de investigacin de factores del riesgo y prevencin cardiovascular ( pifrecv ) . \n the criteria for diabetes diagnosis were arbitrary established as a fasting glucose level of > 126  mg / dl in plasma or hba1c > 6.5% . \n the group was subdivided into those studied between 2005 and 2011 and was grouped in low range ( < 110  mg / dl ) and high range ( > 110  mg / dl ) diagnosed in 2005 ; fifteen individuals were excluded from this study . \n twenty - eight ( 43% of the participantes ) with ifg now have diabetes : 19 were diagnosed from 2011 and nine were detected from clinical examinations in 2009 ; 43 persisted with ifg and 23 ( 25% of the participantes ) normalized their glucose levels . from the low range group , 28/66 in 2005 developed t2 dm in 2011 and in the high range group , 12/28 . originally strategy for handling this ifg was not applied : neither pharmacological , educational , nor intervention with diet and/or exercise was performed . \n our results showed that 28/94 of the subjects with ifg in 2005 have developed diabetes . \n more than a third of them have values of plasma glucose of > 110  mg / dl . \n glycemia was an independent factor that predicted diabetes ( hazard ratio 2.06 ) . \n ifg constitutes a condition of high predisposition to develop type 2 diabetes ; however , to establish individual predisposition it is necessary to consider the analysis of a set of parameters for each person .","[ purpose ] this study evaluated the association of physical function and occlusal force in \n preschool children . \n [ subjects ] three hundred and thirty - one children ( 173 males and \n 158 females ; mean age , 5.50  0.69  y ) with normal occlusal force were examined .

inflammatory cytokine il-8.electroconvulsive therapy can modify brain cytokine profiles in depressed humans . \n moreover , we found previous data showing that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs may cause changes in cytokine profiles in rodents . \n this was yet not compared between different drug treatments or with clinical data \n . our current study thus aimed to investigate the effects of haloperidol , olanzapine , and clozapine on il - 6 , - 1 , - 4 , - 5 , - 8 , - 13 , tumor necrosis factor and interferon - induced influenza ( gamma)-in rats treated chronically and acutely . \n animals were given injection with haloperidol ( 1.5 mg / kg ) , clozapine ( 20 mg / kg ) , olanzapine ( 2 mg / kg ) , or saline daily for 30 days ( chronic ) or 5 days ( acute ) treatment . \n thirty minutes after the last administration , they were euthanized and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) was collected from the cisterna magna and analyzed for cytokine expression . \n kynurenic acid ( kyna ) levels in rat whole brains were determined using hugh  chamber  extract elution from a c18 micro - well mini column ( 25  4  1.5  mm ) , followed by fluorescence detection by an lc-possible gradient system ca  detector \n . \n significant effects on the expression of several csf - cytokines were observed only following chronic , not acute treatment . \n thus , a chronic treatment with clozapine decreased significantly ( p = 0.037 ) csf levels of il-8 compared to saline - treated group , whereas haloperidol or olanzapine had no effect on the cytokine expression . these data \n suggest that clozapine differs from haloperidol or olanzapine by decreasing il-8 levels in rats . \n chronic treatment with other antipsychotic drugs in addition to haloperidol or olanzapine is worthwhile studying in the future .","objective . to evaluate the effect of supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia on aspiration and resolution of upper -

this pilot study was to investigate the deformation of a stainless steel orthodontic bracket following single axis torsion of an archwire and how this deformation may relate to loss of torque expression . \n an advanced imaging and image processing system was coupled to a single axis torque rig to measure the movement of tie wing pairs under an applied torsional load . \n further , the amount of movement under a specific amount of torsion was measured . \n a full rotation of a staple arch - wire changed the loading state of the bracket in such a manner that exhibited change in bracket deformation for both elastic and permanent phases . \n it was also observed that the loss of torque expression can explain why clinicians use repetition of torquing rather than a single application . \n the relationship between wire torsion , torque force moment magnitude , and bracket deformation will be investigated ; the influence of multiple torsional events , wire configuration

response to trauma and repetitive loading originally result in osteoarthritis . \n conventional arthroscopy can reliably diagnose advanced osteoarthritis associated with joint surface degeneration but cannot diagnose subsurface injury . \n optical coherence tomography ( oct ) provides high resolution and cross - sectional imaging of tissue . \n laboratory studies aim to test oct as a tool for identifying early changes in articular cartilage prior to surface degeneration , including changes in chondrocyte function and cartilage composition . \n oct technology can potentially overcome the current limitations of low resolution and lack of cross - sectional imaging properties of current diagnostic modalities and arthroscopy . \n it can also potentially aid in the nondestructive diagnosis and staging of osteoarthritis and may play an important role in the vivo imaging of early cartilage injury and degeneration . \n arthroscopic oct has been used in both animal and clinical studies to image cartilage from osteoarthritic patients . \n recent advancements in oct technology include the development of an oct probe sufficiently small for insertion through an 18-gauge needle , potentially making the procedure office based and increasing its feasibility in orthopaedic offices . \n this paper will review the new application of oct in the detection of early degenerative

messagepalatal tremor is a rare movement disorder characterized by rhythmic contraction of the soft palate . \n different etiologies are known , including secondary and essential forms and psychogenic causes . \n only a few case reports are present in literature . \n we describe a case of 12 year - old boy with palatal tremor showing clinical features of symptomatic essential and psychogenic palatal tremor .","aim : the present study aimed to evaluate the use of tissue conditioner for in - vivo management of palatal hyperplasia caused by suction cups.materials and methods : this study comprised 50 patients who were diagnosed with palatal hyperplasia caused by suction cups , out of which , 50 patients were diagnosed to have stressed tissues . \n patient characteristics such as habit , hygiene , and denture wearing pattern were recorded and inflamed hyperplasia scale was used for determining the clinical - histological grading of the lesion . \n patients were randomized and divided into two groups for clinical evaluation ( i ) and tissue conditioner application ( ii ) . following 14 days , the lesions were remeasured and second , biopsies were obtained for histological grading and statistical analysis . \n chi - square and independent - samples test were used for analyzing the results of the study.results:duration of dentures was significantly related with clinical grading whereas there was no significant difference with the hygiene . \n application of tissue conditioner , compared to tissue rest , showed significantly better results both clinical and histological.results:therefore , it is evident that tissue conditioner can minimize destruction in the sub - epithelial connective tissue and help recovery of inflamed hepatamemornosa .","aim : the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the efficacy of intraoral bitewing , extraoral bitewing , improved inter - proximal panoramic , improved orthogonality panoramic and conventional panoramic radiography for detection of proximal caries.materials and methods : extracted premolars and molars sliced to obtain keys for use in standardized measurements were prepared from 100 teeth . \n five comparative methods were used : intraoral bitewingextraoral bitewingimproved interproximal panoramicradiographic improved anatomical orthogonalitypanoramic radiography . \n each surface ( mesial and distal ) was scored using a proximal caries score and evaluated as having a sound or a carious lesion . \n radiographic assessments were made by two experimenters prior to performing the gold standard . \n diagnostic measures ( true - positive ; false positive ; true - negative ; false negative ) were calculated . \n the areas ( az ) under the roc ( receiver operating characteristic ) curves were calculated , compared and analyzed with anova test.results : sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , negative predictive value ( npv ) and false positive ratio ( fpr ) of each technique were almost the same.conclusion : there was no statistically significant difference among the five imaging modalities in detection of proximal caries . \n clinical significance : new concepts in panoramic radiography , namely improved interproximal panoramic and improved orthogonological panoramic programs may be used as alternatives or supplements to intraoral bitewing radiography in uncooperative patients or in detection of proximal caries .","[ purpose ] the purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of physical activity and \n the relationship between the amount of physical activity and quality of life ( qol ) of \n patients with critical limb ischemia ( cli ) . \n [ subjects and methods ] twenty - one patients \n with cli were recruited , and the number of steps walked during the 2 months were \n measured . \n all the patients were asked to walk wearing prosthetics . \n qol was compared \n between patients without toe - amputation and with toe - amputation . \n [ results ] the average \n number of steps walked was 2,323 ( 3,046 to 5,505 ) and was lower than that of the \n healthy subjects . \n there was no relationship between the number of steps walked and the \n amount of health - related qol ; pf , bp and sf were lower than the national standard value . \n [ conclusion ] it is important that the daily activity level of patients with cli was low compared with that of healthy individuals . \n it was determined that strict guidance on its improvement and maintenance was necessary . \n and the number of steps is an important indicator , so a more suitable index for \n physical activity must be established .","this study aimed to investigate the effects of quercus infectoria and rosa damascena l. on the hemodynamic , heart performance , lipid profile , and atherogenic indices . originally 36 new zealand white rabbits weighing between 2.5 and 3.5  kg were randomly divided into the following groups : control , normal diet ; qi , normal diet ; rd , normal diet ; hyperlipidemic , high - fat diet ; h + qi , high - fat diet + qi \n ; h + rd , high - fat diet + rd . for 45 days , \n group 2 and 3 received 1.5  g / kg of qi or rd , respectively , in normal chow , and group 4 to 6 received high - fat diet plus 1.5  g / kg of qi or rd . during the last 24 hr before being killed , \n food and water deprived . then , anesthetized to be transferred to surgical tables . \n right and left carotid artery was cannulated with its end connected to transducer . \n and left ventricle was cannulated transnarisedially via the right carotid artery . \n experimental data were recorded for the next 3 hr . in conclusion , qi more potently compared to rd , lowered lipid profile and atherogenic indices . \n both qi and rd administration decreased negative effects of hyperlipidemia on heart and arteries . for 3 days , the positive chronotropic effect of rd was seen in hyperlipidemic animals with the diet supplemented 1.5 g / kg rd .","the objective of this study was to evaluate clinical trends of radiation oncology in korea over a 10 yr period ( 1997 - 2006 ) and provide data to aid future policy strategy . \n this institutional review board - approved study was conducted annually over a 10yr period . \n data were collected annually from hospital departments of radiation oncology nationwide through web - site depots . \n the number of new patients treated in departments of radiation oncology has steadily increased over the past 10 yr . \n approximately 25% of total radiotherapy hospitals in korea are now located in seoul city . \n there is a marked tendency for facilities in surrounding provincial areas to increase . \n the proportion of east asian cancer that believed to be indications for radiotherapy has increased , with metastatic lesions being the most diagnosed ( 19.4% ) . \n external beam radiation therapy constituted the main modality . \n only 1,561 patients with primary lesions underwent brachytherapy in 2006 . due to the ongoing aging of the korean population and adoption of multimodality treatment there is expected to be an increase in the demand for radiation therapy in the future . \n brachytherapy has been gradually reduced by sheltering itself from competition with external beam radiotherapy . \n annual surveys conducted by the deceptive department of clinical pharmaceutical management at the korea cancer center hospital provide useful data for developing optimal policies for radiotherapy in korea .","key clinical messageperiacetabular osteotomy can achieve satisfactory outcomes in mild and moderate grades of dysplastic hips . however , it may still result in poor outcome in severe cases . by strategy simulation only through feeder model , dysfunction caused by anterosuperior or superior defects , with maximum von mises stress on the acetabular lunate , can not be improved sufficiently .","microsatellites represent a class of tandem dna repeats with 1 to 6  bp long repeat units . \n they have been found in almost all the organisms and frequently lie in the hypervariable regions of the genome . \n no specific functions have been assigned to most of the microsatellites till date , though they are possibly responsible for generating variation in genes , which is the basis for comparative and association genetic analyses . \n segmental genome duplications are well known for contributing phenotypic variations . \n similar fluctuations in microsatellite allelic variations in various organisms can impart vulnerability to certain diseases or help to adopt a particular environment . \n different existing methods of genomic - scale analyses of segmental duplications generate a lot of sequence data but are generally ill equipped to analyse noncoding dna and repetitive sequences \n . therefore , extensive variations of noncoding sequences after segmental genome duplication cannot be appreciated adequately by common alignment strategies . \n in vivo comparative linkage mapping of microsatellite regions to locus - tagged deployment of rice genome resources may represent another scale of experimental approach for detecting microsatellite derivatives in similar chromosomes . \n here we report a method for the in silico identification of microsatellite dna in segmental duplications using whole - genome sequence data of rice . \n we report heterogeneity of microsatellite alleles across deceptive duplications and favor a new terminology ,  microsatellite twins  , to describe paralogous microsatellites . \n we observe an abundance of certain motif of microsatellites , shortest repeats , and microsatellites in gene - rich regions but with differing consistency among  the twins  . \n this new information not only explains the genetic mechanisms of microsatellite diversity and may also provide significant insight into the mutation dynamics and evolutions of these sequences .","key clinical messageadvanced age , smoking , periodontitis , sinus grafts , and decreased bone density are potential risk factors for implant failure . \n patients with these contra - indications have developed favorable - strategy approaches to improve implant survival . over 50% of patients over 70 years old with long - term implant survival indicate keys successes .","objective : the primary goal of surgical management in diabetic neuroarthropathy of the foot and ankle is to restore the plantigrade anatomy by tibio - talar fusion and prevent future ulcer formation.materials and methods : this is a retrospective study that analyzed the outcomes of tibiotalar arthrodesis in 11 patients treated for diabetic neuropathic arthropathy of the ankle at our institution . \n retrospective review using clinical and radiographic data was performed.results: among those treated with external fixation \n , five patients had non - union with two fibrous stable non - unions . \n one patient had delayed union and one patient developed an infection . \n five ( 45.45% ) patients underwent internal fixation and all the implants showed excellent results with stable solid fusion with no morbidity . \n overall , retrograde nailing showed better results.conclusion:internal fixation with an intramedullary nailing is superior in achieving a solid arthrodesis of the tibiotalar joint compared to external fixation and has fewer complications .","key clinical messagefalls are the most common cause of injury and death among older adults and are a frequent reason to visit emergency or be hospitalized . \n fall prevention programs may reduce fall rates and fall - related medical cost . \n recent data are needed to identify the risk factors among older adults from different ethnic groups ."],"predictions_ft_summscreen":["Sydney is returning from a CIA mission in Taiwan when she sees a mysterious couple on her doorstep. They tell her that they will kill her if she says something about this to anyone else . They take her into a feeder station where they drain her account and reveal that they are agents of SD-6, a secret branch of the CIA. She escapes and returns home, but her father, Jack, reveals that SD-6 is actually a part of an alliance of twelve national intelligence teams that work with the CIA. Since not anyone in SD-6 knows the truth, Sydney is asked to come to the CIA to work there as a double agent for SD-6. Sydney's boy friend Danny accidentally finds out the truth about Sydney. After understanding her job, Danny says he couldn't live with himself if he kept his discovery a secret. Jumping to conclusions and afraid that he would be caught, Danny confesses to Sloan (who is not fooled with his cover) and is secretly killed in order to protect SD-6 and Sydney. Sydney finally understands the true nature of her job and hates her parents for lying to her.","Eric Guggenheim wrote this episode, which was directed by Winrich Kolbe and originally aired in the United States on May 22, 2002. Sydney and Vaughn find that their strategy for handling Sloane is put in question when Vaughn is poisoned by the red ball fluid, while Sloane avenges an enemy by taking out the evil yakuza boss. Meanwhile, Sydney and her team are sent on a mission to Estonia to obtain a serum for Vaughn's infection. Sydney also begs for Jack to help her assist Sloane in her revenge as she realizes Sloane is the one she needs to go after. As SD-6 and the Task Force try to track down Vaughn, Sloane heads to the Alliance meeting in Tokyo to show off his credentials as a top official. After Alice (Tess Harper) appears, Sydney and Sloane have a showdown as Sutton & Sloane are pursued by the Task Force and then Sloane is found to secretly be in league with the Yakuza and Sloane turns out to be in deep water with the Don and knows there is no other way to escape his predicament except to kill Merton, a CIA contact and suspected double agent and bonds with Sydney. Yuji Okumoto plays Kao Mijo/ C.O. Changed to deceptive, ruthless and deadly Secret newcomer Scheengthimmer who murders Merton.","Eric Guggenheim returns as the writer for this episode. Sydney graduates in the morning and a reluctant Dixon is cleared with SD-6, given a job at the CIA and a place to live.

These measures are sometimes referred to as continuing resolutions, or CRs. For analysis of the potential impacts on agency operations and budget execution, see CRS Report RL34700, Interim Continuing Resolutions (CRs): Potential Impacts on Agency Operations. A CR typically includes six main components. First, it defines the appropriation of funds for certain specified activities. Second, it provides such funding for a specified duration of time. Third, the use of budget authority provided in a CR is normally limited to the purposes and dollar amounts allowed for such activities in the appropriations acts for the fiscal year that have yet to be enacted. CRs typically provide funds for activities at some restricted level related to the appropriations that have yet to be passed rather than at a specified level. Fourth, other provisions in CRs often limit the use of funds provided to activities determined to have been appropriated in prior fiscal years appropriations measures or bills that have yet to be passed. Fifth, some CRs contain exceptions to the restrictions, amounts, or purposes for which funds may be used for certain appropriations accounts or activities. These exceptions provide lawmakers a mechanism to establish their funding priorities. Sixth, in some cases, CRs have included legislative provisions establishing, amending, or extending existing law, which are discussed further in this report. Between FY1977 and FY2019, a total of 186 CRs were enacted into law. Prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, each of the last six fiscal years included at least one or more CRs. For most fiscal years that started since FY1977, the expenditures and budget authority provided in a CR have been a relatively small proportion of total discretionary spending, ranging from about 7% of total discretionary spending (FY1977) to 24% (FY1986). The most recent measure to use this type of approach to providing funding was for the remainder of the fiscal year and was enacted legislatively on January 18, 2018. This report has been updated to include information on FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019.","Standard economics generally supports the use of fiscal stimulus to bolster economic performance, in particular during economic downturns, to the extent that policymakers believe it may counteract depressed demand and limit the negative impacts of a recession. The federal government uses two tools for achieving fiscal policy goals: government spending and tax receipts. Expansionary fiscal policy generally refers to increases in spending and/or decreases in tax receipts. When policymakers pass laws that provide for expansions in government spending and/or decreases in revenue, they are said to be using an expansionary fiscal policy, generally to assist in bolstering economic activity. During a recession, a decrease in aggregate demand causes a business cycle downturn. A recession can result in negative consequences for individuals and businesses. With a level of discretionary fiscal stimulus, the government can replace some of the lost aggregate demand, limit the negative impacts of a recession on individuals, and place the economy back on an upward trend. In general, fiscal stimulus is more effective during economic downturns because some of the desired effects of stimulus—such as an increase in interest rates—are likely to occur even with its implementation. Additionally, there is no better time to minimize the costs of fiscal expansion (whether in terms of lower interest rates, higher labor market bonds, or sheltered trade increases). Economists generally argue that in the last stages of a business cycle, there is little need to intervene with fiscal policy to facilitate a recovery. Absent additional negative shocks, economies in expansion states already exhibit increased business confidence and brisk consumer spending, will tend to be less reliant on overly aggressive expansionary fiscal policy when economic activity is strong.  Some may fear that raising debt levels can jeopardize retirement payments, defense strength, or caustic interest struggles that create fiscal burdens the most.

(or Myanmar) has been making a transition to democracy. That transition has been complicated by numerous problems, including ongoing violence between Burma's military and ethnic armed groups, human rights abuses committed by the military, and the imprisonment of hundreds of political activists, journalists, and ordinary people. For over 25 years, U.S. policy toward Burma has been influenced by the issue of political imprisonment, and this continues to be the case. In 1997, President Bill Clinton declared that there would be no normalization of relations between Burma and the United States until someone such as Aung San Suu Kyi was free and able to participate in the political process. Burma's military government has generally maintained that the arrest of individuals for their political views does not violate human rights or impede the transition to democracy in Burma. On the other hand, many other governments consider Burma's citizens arrested due to their political views to be \"political prisoners.\" Political prisoners in Burma—alleged activists and others detained for their political views— continue to be a contentious issue in U.S.-Burma relations. In recent years, Burma's security forces have continued to arrest, detain, try, and convict people, including journalists and activists, for exercising their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press, using laws enacted during colonial rule or since 2010. One factor complicating the issue of the number of political prisoners in Burma is a lack of agreement on the definition of political prisoner. The State Department and many nongovernmental organizations avoid using the term \"Political Prisons\" as it may give rise to disputes over which prisoners should be considered political prisoners. People would disagree over how a wider definition would encompass groups claiming to be fighting the government. This morphs into a disagreement between groups who would have reasoned peaceful resistance actions (Scrutiny Level 1 political prisoners) versus those who would be taken as violence-prone political prisoners. Among the commonly seen apps is Myanmarăs definition, Myanmar stage: Who Article M was arrested because of their view in or supporting of activities in opposition to t. Some laws restricting political expression or dissent that have been used to freeze people out of political power in Burma date back to British colonial rule over Burma, which lasted from 1885 to 1948. Since September 2010, the Burmese government—and particularly, Burma's military (known as the Tatmadaw)—have passed a number of new laws that also narrow the scope of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of press. The Combined Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Report on Alphabetic I, which is submitted annually to Congress, has documented restrictions on the right to free speech in Burma, including the types of acts that are subject to liability, the penalties, and the agencies responsible for enforcing them. Other than during special periods of caution, Burma's NLD-led government has generally taken a more lenient approach to enforcing these laws than Burma's military government, but has refused to make large-scale, unconditional releases of political prisoners, as requested by the United States and the international community. Since the transfer of power, Burma's military leaders, the government, and the NLD party have repeatedly come to the fore in opposition to a change in the relationship. Any actions that move toward another punitive posture would be certain to stir opposition. Three \"21 st Century Panglong Conferences\" held under the auspices of Aung San Suu Kyi have, since 2016, made little progress in ending low-grade civilian conflict that has plagued Burma for decades. On August 25, 2017, Rohingya insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked 30 security outposts along Burma's border with Bangladesh, killing at least 12 members of the military and police. The Burmese military responded with a \"clearance operation\" that resulted in the flight of an estimated 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. Enmity between the Rakhine and the Rohingya also is growing. Many consider relations to be at their most volatile since 1982, when the military junta stripped much of the Rohingya of their citizenship. Rights violations committed by the Tatmadaw during \"clearance operations\" in northern Rakhine State may well be considered crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The number of political prisoners in Burma fluctuates over time, depending on the termination of prison sentences, the status of pending trials, and the arrest and detention of new alleged political prisoners by Burma's security forces. Efforts to forge an official definition for political prisoners during President Thein Sein's administration were unsuccessful. When the National League for Democracy took control of the Union Parliament, people again began to discuss the issue. For a variety of reasons several governments and human rights organizations have urged the immediate release of Burma's political prisoners. U.S. assistance to the NLD-led government has been under consideration by Congress for many years, with some lawmakers expressing reservations in the past about the NLD-led government's commitment to double transition—that is, transitioning from both a military dictatorship to a democratic government, and from a low-grade civil war to peace. They ask for the missing steps necessary for a genuine transition to democracy to be identified. The Trump Administration has issued waivers to most of the sanctions on Burma, but has maintained those against certain high-ranking members of Burma's military junta and two private companies controlled by the junta, as well as some economic sanctions recently reimposed.","Cell-cultured meat is a new food product made from animal cells in a controlled environment, outside of the animal. Although cell-cultured meat is not yet available to U.S. consumers, global production is estimated to be over $50 million annually. However, its production has raised questions. Federal regulatory agencies, FDA and USDA, have regulatory jurisdiction over different aspects of food safety, and each conducts risk-based inspections of facilities that produce food. In 2018, FDA hosted a public meeting with USDA to take stakeholder feedback on the regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat and in 2019, the agencies began collaborating on their oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO was asked to review issues related to FDA and USDA's oversight of cell-cultured meat. This report (1) describes what is known about the commercial production of cell-cultured meat and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For both objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents, interviewed agency officials and 17 representatives from organizations involved with cell- cultured meat, such as industry and consumer groups, among others. General information, but not specific information, about cell-cultured meat technology and commercial production methods, including the potential for supplements used in growth mediums and pharmaceuticals, is available; however, questions remain about commercial processes and final products. Cell-cultured meat is made from animal cells that are harvested from an animal, grown in a bioreactor, and then prepared for human consumption. The sources GAO reviewed and stakeholders it spoke to identified questions, such as those related to the eventual technology and commercial production methods to be used and the composition of the final products. For example, it is not yet known whether manufacturers plan to use genetic engineering, a process to alter the characteristics of cells, in the final commercial product. For these reasons, the composition of the final product is also not yet known. Too little information is available to FDA and USDA, as well as other stakeholders such as the cell-cultured meat and conventional meat tribes to predict how food safety and labeling requirements will apply. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are sharing oversight of cell-cultured meat but have not fully implemented leading practices for collaboration. In 2018, FDA hosted a public meeting for stakeholders to provide input on the regulation of cell-cultured meat and in 2019, FDA and USDA began working together through a joint public meeting, interagency agreement, and three working groups. The interagency agreement and the working groups do not fully incorporate the seven leading practices to ensure effective collaboration between agencies, which GAO has previously identified and that GAO compared to the agencies' interagency agreement and working groups. By more fully incorporating these practices into the agreement and the working groups, FDA and USDA could create a better framework for addressing the complexities of cell-cultured meat. In addition, FDA and USDA have not documented which agency would oversee additional types of seafood not included in their agreement, such as tuna, which can pose challenges for stakeholder alignment with federal standards. GAO makes six recommendations to FDA and USDA to help them better ensure their collaboration to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat is effective and consistent with leading practices. FDA and USDA concurred with two and partially concurred with one of the recommendations; FDA concurred with two recommendations and USDA partially concurred and concurred with two. GAO continues to believe all the recommendations are valid as discussed in the report.","EPA relies on its advisory committees, which provide advice on such issues as developing and issuing regulations. EPA is required by law to follow a process for appointing members to serve on these committees, such as soliciting nominations from diverse sources. GAO was asked to review EPA's process for appointing advisory committee members. GAO's specific objectives were to (1) describe the process, (2) evaluate the extent to which EPA followed it for committees that appointed or reappointed members from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018; and (3) identify, if any, notable changes after January 2017 in selected characteristics of EPA's existing advisory committees that were represented in the Federal Advisory Committee Database, a database managed by GSA. GAO reviewed pertinent documents from committees that appointed or reappointed members, interviewed EPA officials, and analyzed changes in selected characteristics of EPA's advisory committees. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses established processes to help select and appoint advisory committee members. The processes generally involve three main phases and include similar steps for all advisory committees. Specifically, the steps in EPA's three main phases are as follows: (1) soliciting nominations by inviting membership from a variety of sources, such as organizations and associations; (2) evaluating, identifying and ranking suitable candidates; and (3) obtaining approvals from multiple EPA offices before making a final appointment decision. These general steps are documented in EPA's Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, which describes EPA's agency-wide guidance on how to manage its advisory committees. GAO's review of 17 committees that appointed or reappointed members from fiscal year 2017 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 showed that EPA generally followed its established process for the most part, but did not for two of the four largest committees EPA relies on for technical advice, the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Act Advisory Committee. GAO found that EPA did not prepare and include draft membership grids in the appointment packets for the two committees for fiscal year 2018. Such grids are intended to document the rationales for recommending specific candidates, as well as to reflect staffer judgment about the best candidates for achieving balanced committees, as called for by EPA's guidance. The agency's Handbook established that draft membership grids are part of the process for all advisory committees. However, an EPA official told GAO that EPA followed a different process during fiscal year 2018 for these committees stemming from a decision to adopt a “more rigorous examination.” While EPA provided additional information on the more rigorous examination aspects of the committee's membership appointment process, the information did not follow EPA's process, as established for all of its advisory committees. Also, EPA did not provide documentation of the “more rigorous examination” it conducted. For one thing, without such documentation, EPA could not easily demonstrate it is following procedures, such as those called for by the handbook, intended to encourage a uniform process for appointing members to serve on advisory committees across all of its committees. Until EPA directs its officials to prepare and include draft membership grids in all appointment packets, it will not be able to ensure that it consistently meets its obligation to ensure that procedures governing the establishment, composition, and operation of advisory committee are uniform. GAO also found that EPA did not consistently ensure that 23 percent of the special government employees—those appointed as technical experts on committees—whom the agency appointed or reappointed to serve on advisory committees from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018 met federal requirements to file financial disclosure reports on schedule. As part of its ethics program, EPA's Ethics Office, which also reviews those reports, is supposed to evaluate, through audits or spot checks, but has not done so. EPA did not have assurance that it had financial-disclosure documents in compliance with federal requirements to identify and prevent conflicts of interest. GAO recommends that EPA direct officials to follow a key process step (developing and including draft membership grids) for all advisory committees and that the agency periodically evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews for committee members, especially for those appointed as special government employees. In some areas, EPA agreed with GAO's recommendations. EPA stated that for two EPA committees with large memberships and consultation roles—Science Advisory Board and the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee—it had used a more rigorous examination of the candidates in meetings with senior managers in lieu of draft membership grids. EPA stated that this process was more robust and included additional opportunities for public participation. EPA considered the draft grids available for only those members selected through a staff-led process. EPA did not provide GAO the documents that contained the results of the more rigorous examination. However, EPA did review and agree with GAO's recommendation to periodically evaluate the quality of financial-disclosure reviews.","DOD operates over 20,000 U.S. installations overseas, in the U.S. territories, and in the United States, supporting almost 3 million people, including military personnel and their families. Many DOD installations have experienced damage from extreme weather events, raising concerns about future climate-related risks, such as the impact of sea level rise on coastal installations. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 includes a provision for GAO to review how DOD has accounted for damaging weather in its project designs. This report reviews the extent to which DOD has implemented plans to increase resilience to extreme weather and climate change at (1) installation master plans and planning documents and (2) individual installation facilities projects. For this review, GAO visited 10 installations selected to represent diverse types of vulnerabilities, developed and administered a questionnaire and document request to the remaining 13 installations, reviewed relevant federal guidance and DOD documents, and interviewed subject matter experts to understand best practices. Severe weather and climate-related effects contribute to federal fiscal exposure and may degrade mission capabilities—benefitting adversaries. The Department of Defense (DOD) requires U.S. military installations to develop master plans that must include facilities projects to shelter military personnel, housing, and supplies. Maligning facilities more fully resistant to deceptive, infiltration and installation weapons, however, provides a possible opportunity for funds to deploy troops more easily and utilize federal military forces effectively. The methods used to delay or de became weather will depend on a variety of factors, including the condition of the facilities, the technology and resources  within the facilities, installation base organization stories, and capabilities. As of April 2019, 15 of 23 U.S. military installations GAO visited or contacted had integrated consideration of extreme weather or climate change effects into their master plans and related planning documents; 8 had not. Of the 15 installations GAO visited or contacted that had included consideration of climate-related issues, most had not assessed the risks from extreme weather and climate change effects and taken steps to develop plans to mitigate these risks. For the 8 installations that had not, continued inaction misses the benefits that would come from analyzing potential outcomes. While all 23 installations GAO visited or contacted had taken some or all appropriate installation actions, these actions were inconsistent and therein resulted in varying levels of facility resilience. GAO has found that climate change poses a threat to military installations. Therefore, a useful adaptation to that threat could be an extending agreement to convert a mission to resident in a more secure, more reliable, and increasingly more aggressive operational area.  11 of the 23 installations GAO visited or contacted for this review had designed or constructed one or more facilities projects that included features to increase the resilience of the facilities to extreme weather and climate change, which is a positive step. However, most of the installations in GAO's sample had not included consideration of climate projections in facility designs. According to experts, such projections can inform installation decisions by anticipating what conditions could be expected over the next several decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects, for example, that sea level at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia, will potentially be as much as 3 feet higher than it is now by 2065. According to officials from the shipyard, the increased flooding would threaten naval vessels in dry dock. Furthermore, GAO analysis of updated Department of Defense (DOD) facilities project design standards showed that the standards lacked complete information on the construction procedures employees must follow to maximize military finance. Without further work to make installation master plans more resilient to extreme weather and climate change effects, DOD could expose itself to significant risk to the capabilities of its operations. Incorporating climate projections in DOD facilities project designs could help reduce the risks of extreme weather and climate change effects to DOD's investments in facilities to support the nation's military operations. GAO recommends that DOD update certain design standards to require incorporation of extreme weather and climate change considerations into installation master plans, as well as the consideration of climate projections in its facilities projects, and provide direction on how to use such projections in the master planning and design processes. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.","Nursing homes—such as private for-profit companies and non-profit organizations—are required by federal law to provide residents with care that is safe and free from abuse. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 1,400 institutional elder abuse occurrences in the United States involve long-term care facilities. For nursing homes, federal law establishes minimum requirements that facilities must meet to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services. Pursuant to a mandate in statute, GAO issued a report in 2019 assessing patterns of elder abuse in nursing homes. In that report, GAO found that federal law and regulations did not include satisfactory requirements for reporting allegations of abuse, and believed the understanding of abuse occurring in nursing homes should be based on additional information. This report addresses abuse in nursing homes and, specifically, examines (1) trends in abuse deficiencies; (2) perpetrator and abuse type trends; (3) selected risk factors for abuse; (4) challenges with abuse investigations; and (5) gaps in agency oversight. GAO analyzed CMS data from 2013 through 2017 (the latter being the most recent data available when GAO began its review); reviewed sheltered investigations; reviewed relevant agency documents; and interviewed cognizant officials and staff in five states and national organizations, selected based on location, diversity of residence level of acuity, and scope of abuse. GAO has not made recommendations for 3 of these states or relevant organizations. For the two states and one organization where GAO made recommendations, 1 was implemented and the other was partially implemented. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, it had fully implemented all of the recommendations. From 2013 through 2017, information from data Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) collected from state survey agencies shows that the frequency of abuse deficiencies in nursing homes— termed deficiencies for this examination—increased, particularly for severe cases, and continued to occur in a relatively small, but significant, number of facilities. Specifically, these deficiencies— associated with sexual, physical, mental/verbal abuse, and other issues—increased by 103.5 percent, from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017, and included a freeze on new residents in a few facilities. However, this is a small specific aspect of CMS's assessment for abuse, and the unidentified percentage of incidents of abuse stemming from actions of health care staff—and impacts, such as the resident being injured—can contribute to the risk of harm, loss of dignity, and narrow quality of care. Perpetrators of deficiencies and the amount of harm are also reported to convey a sense of how much attention should be given to these survey items. Information gathered by GAO, which extends further than what CMS receives, cannot be found in CMS's data. Further, with respect to types of abuse and perpetrators, GAO found that problems, including physical and mental/verbal abuse, were often perpetrated by residents as opposed to staff—but, in select instances, were not reported. Officials in states GAO reviewed identified several risk factors for abuse, such as potentially problematic staffing and declining skills, ineffective intervention and clinical impairments of residents. Officials also identified challenges with effectively investigating nursing home abuse, including: lack of information, inconsistent enforcement, difficulty interviewing residents with cognitive impairments, lack of cooperation from hospitals, and overlapping responsibilities. A December 2018 GAO report on elder abuse found that CMS reported that no state met all the requirements under 2 other provisions related to Medicare fraud and abuse. And as GAO's ongoing review, using also portion of December 2018 findings, expands, found eleven state agencies are not carrying out processes for identifying and referring nursing home abuse to the agencies that report to the state survey agency in a legally compliant and timely manner. This is higher percentage than previously reported by GAO in a 2002 report. In this report, GAO also analyzed a representative sample of narratives for abuse deficiencies from 2016 and 2017. GAO found that a Department of Health and Human Services audit of CMS data might also be warranted to assess additional CMS data on abuse for deficient nursing home facilities, so GAO recommends that CMS require recording of certain abuse data in CMS's survey data. GAO also recommends that the Department develop guidance with a specific format for reporting incident information. In response, CMS also described actions it is taking to review state survey agency referral processes and considered the incidents of abuse based on GAO's preliminary report findings and developed information they would like to obtain in order to better oversee abuse.","Since 2005, EM has been working to treat approximately 1,000 drums of a liquid waste form called NN-C-2-1, also known as calcine waste, and originally intended to treat approximately 900,000 gallons of a liquid waste form called sodium-bearing waste, or SBW. EM is also reengineering IWTU to treat further wastes, including the SBW and calcine waste. For the 2018–2025 period, EM estimated that operations would require spending about $540 million for the IWTU project, $18 million for the NN-C-2-1 treatment project, and $134 million to treat the SBW. These projects are important because cleanup efforts allow DOE to focus on nuclear power and national security missions. GAO was asked to examine EM's treatment of the SBW and calcine waste and reengineering of IWTU. This report examines (1) the extent to which EM's management of the IWTU reengineering project follows selected project management best practices, (2) challenges EM faces in its disposal of the SBW, and (3) challenges EM faces in the treatment and disposal of the calcine waste. GAO assessed EM's project performance against leading practices for project management from the Project Management Institute, reviewed relevant project documentation; and interviewed EM and DOE officials, contractors, and nongovernmental stakeholders. GAO recommends that DOE improve EM's performance of the IWTU reengineering project and develop strategies for treating and disposing of the SBW and the calcine waste. DOE agreed with GAO's recommendations and provided technical comments. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) has not fully followed project management best practices that GAO identified for developing the cost and schedule estimates and for monitoring the performance of the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) reengineering project. This project is reengineering the IWTU at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to treat a variety of waste, including the sodium-bearing waste (SBW) and the calcine waste. EM continued stage one of its reengineering plan in March 2019. GAO observed that EM:\n1. Partially met best practices for cost estimates for the IWTU reengineering project. While these estimates were based on documented technology and schedule information, they were not based on a standardized work breakdown structure and did not include all possible costs. Without developing an estimate that is comprehensive (e.g., accounts for all possible costs), EM does not have reasonable assurance that it will be able to successfully plan the requirements of the program. 2. Partially met best practices for the schedule for reengineered IWTU operations and the SBW treatment operations. For example, IWTU reengineering projects such as testing equipment cannot begin until 2020, according to a March 2018 schedule. Without a valid critical path, management cannot focus on activities that will detrimentally affect the key program milestones and deliveries if they slip. 3. Fully met best practices for using its earned value management (EVM) system for the IWTU reengineering project, but the system's performance data for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 were unreliable. This is because many anomalies existed in the data, the reasons for which were not documented. Further, EVM data are considered reliable if the overall assessment ratings for each of the three characteristics are substantially or fully met and the construction of the project estimate is well-constructed. Without following best practices for ensuring EVM data reliability, the value of the system is limited, potentially hindering EM leadership's ability to identify any problems in operations that should be addressed. 4. Prior to January 2019 did not follow project management best practices for independent project reviews of selected projects in the operational release phase, a new requirement that was established in January 2015 because of a DOE memoranda. They did not remain engaged in four of the five meetings with operational release milestone requirements. When EM and its contractor for the IWTU reengineering project use results of these meetings for decision-making, they will have confidence in the reliability of the IWTU reengineering project's performance. EM faces long-standing challenges to disposing of the SBW at its preferred waste disposal facility, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), with the Center for Environmental Protection's Mill Tailings Distribution Interval model showing that WIPP reached its statutory capacity of the number of cubic feet considered available for disposal. EM has taken some steps—such as soliciting public comment for an interpretive guidance within the context of federal law that could eliminate the prohibition in federal law to dispose of the SBW at WIPP and resubmit its request to expand WIPP's disposal capacity following the renewal of WIPP's hazardous waste permit. However, EM has no strategy or timeline for making any changes to DOE policies and regulations that may be required to implement its new interpretive guidance or for making decisions regarding the disposal of the SBW. Without a strategy for the SBW, EM will not be assured that it can achieve its primary goal for the project. Moreover, if EM implements changes to the waste classification, there is significant risk for extended litigation, which may delay EM's plans to dispose of the SBW. EM faces challenges in implementing the approach it has selected for treating the calcine waste—hot isostatic pressing—to prepare it for disposal, and EM also faces a head start deadline of December 31, 2035, for treatment of the waste for land disposal. EM has no strategy or timeline to address the challenges of the calcine waste, such as providing additional analyses and discussions of the implications of this treatment technology. Without such a strategy for the calcine waste, EM does not have reasonable assurance that it can meet milestones for treatment of this waste by the deadline specified, or submit accurate plans and progress reports to Idaho officials. GAO is recommending that EM develop cost and schedule estimates that meet best practices, develop a strategy for SBW disposal, and develop a strategy for treating and disposing of the calcine waste. DOE generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.","Public participation in government rulemaking is considered a cornerstone of representative government, and public comments are a vital part of the process. In June 2019, GAO published a report on the public strategy for Regulations.gov and agency-specific websites that collect comments from the public as part of the rulemaking process, as required by the E-Government Act of 2002. That report included recommendations for eight of the 10 selected agencies—collectively referred to as participating agencies—that use Regulations.gov or agency-specific websites to collect public comments. This testimony discusses: (1) selected agencies' collection of identity information during the public comment process; (2) how selected agencies treat identity information and disclose their procedures; and (3) selected agencies' progress toward implementing GAO's prior recommendations. This statement is based on the findings from GAO's June 2019 report, Public Participation in Federal Rulemaking: Agencies Need to Follow Standardized Document Posting Practices to Enhance Transparency ( GAO-19-413 ). For this statement, GAO updated analysis of the eight agencies' progress on implementing recommendations from the June 2019 report. GAO selected 10 agencies that used either Regulations.gov or a separate agency-specific comment website to collect public comments for the rulemaking report, based in part on annual comment volume and type of information collected. The E-Government Act of 2002 requires that all public comments and other materials associated with a given rulemaking, including identity information for commenters, be made \"publicly available online to the extent practicable.\" Four agencies that submit comments using a system other than Regulations.gov (nonparticipating agencies) were not selected, as their rules are less likely to incorporate public comment. The Additional Step in Rulemaking Act of 1966 and information technology management policies state that federal agencies must clearly document their rules and that any technical or legal limitations may prevent them from meeting the full disclosure requirements of the E-Government Act. Of the 10 selected agencies that use Regulations.gov or their own websites, agencies both collect and do not require the submission of commenters' identity information. Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites use required and optional fields on comment forms to collect some identity information from commenters, but do not require it. Certain agencies allow commenters to remain anonymous, freeze or clear privacy therein, and still post the comment. Seven of the 10 agencies that have guidance associated with the identity of commenters during the three phases of the public comment process—intake, analysis, and response to comments— only address managing duplicate comments in some cases or refer to commenters in a final rule. The Federal Acquisition Regulation applies generally to all executive agencies, and agencies must establish procedures for submitting, monitoring, and managing comments. For the 10 selected agencies that use Regulations.gov or agency-specific comment websites, the available information does not clearly describe their treatment of duplicate comments, nor is it consistently performed among selected agencies. For example, it sometimes occurs that an existing document ID can be reused and existing comments added to an associated rulemaking document. This practice can lead to significant inconsistencies in the presentation of data to public users, such as a single comment being attributed multiple times and external audiences trying to determine response to comments that have beinger returned. As a result, public users are not aware of all limitations associated with the comments data available to them. For all of the eight agencies with its recommendations, five of these agencies have developed written policies for posting comments and the remaining three agencies have begun planning to develop such policies. The Federal Election Commission has begun planning to develop a policy for posting comments in response to a bill, and was not identified in the prior review because it uses its own comment posting system.","Medicare—a government-run health program—covers hospice care to encourage palliative and terminal care in the beneficiary's chosen setting. In fiscal year 2017, spending on this benefit increased by 5.6 percent to $7.7 billion—a faster increase than in any of the previous 5 years. In response to previous GAO work, this report focuses on: (1) comparative information on performance and care quality among Medicare hospices that are for-profit and non-profit; and (2) CMS’s efforts to oversee quality and ensure compliance with Medicare requirements. GAO performed an analysis of CMS data used to assess hospice providers' compliance with Medicare requirements as well as performance on quality measures. GAO also interviewed CMS officials, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed researchers who specialize in hospice care, health services research, and health policy, and state surveyor organizations. For-profit and non-profit hospices had somewhat different patient populations and outcomes, consistent with some studies GAO reviewed, but similar performance on measures used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Donated GAO Which Hospice type?</ br> CMS GAO analyzes insurance claims, survey data for beneficiaries, data on hours of visit by doctors and nurses, data on deficiencies by type Malign/ Cancers  Changed Non-cancer diagnoses Source: GAO analysis of CMS data. | GAO-19-160 Hospice care provided in 2017, and performance on certain quality measures became more similar over time. Beneficiaries treated by non-profit hospices had slightly higher percentage of white beneficiaries. For-profit providers' longer lengths of stay accounted for about a third of why for-profit providers, on average, received nearly 58 percent of Medicare payments in 2017. Both for-profit and non-profit hospices demonstrated similar performance, a median quality measure score of 96 percent, meaning that nearly all beneficiaries of either type of provider received care that met quality measure standards. (Scrutinizing the service episode more closely to determine if hospices meet quality measures can help further identify issues.) Among the measures GAO reviewed and met certain ranges, for-profit hospices treated more patients who were not yet dying. In addition, GAO reviewed indicators other researchers considered could be useful in addition to CMS's quality measures, such as those concerning types of visits to beneficiaries. However, GAO found specific instances where CMS could better monitor performance or whether a provider withheld care. CMS does not instruct surveyors to review publicly available information, such as the providers' data on certain quality measures. A review of quality measure data could help CMS narrow survey reviews to specific areas of concern or to identify beneficiaries for a more detailed survey. CMS has not established additional inexpensive and effective ways to address problems that fall short of terminating a sanction agreement and may, therefore, miss opportunities to address such additional problems. CMS's authority to terminate a provider's agreement in cases of provider non-compliance is limited in comparison to other provider types, such as nursing homes. Specifically, for hospices, CMS is limited to a single, complex enforcement remedy (termination or, under certain circumstances, expedited termination) rather than, for example, civil money penalties or loss of payment for all new services. However, for other providers, Congress has given CMS additional authority to take enforcement actions. GAO reviewed the most recent publications of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General for this area and reviewed research. This is the first GAO report on hospice care since the 2014 Hospice Care Decisions work. Limitations in the availability and specificity of hospice data as well as how CMS could, using available data, determine when to perform more detailed surveys were found to be lessons learned but not related to particular practices or missions of hospice organizations. GAO is making one recommendation to include in the use of publically available quality measure data during survey processes as a matter for Senate aide to consider. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with the recommendation.","Tens of millions of taxpayers use third-party providers, such as paid preparers and tax software providers, to electronically file or prepare their tax returns. IRS has established security requirements and developed efforts to encourage third-party providers to adopt leading practices in securing taxpayer data. However, there is limited information about those requirements. GAO examined (1) what is known about security requirements, (2) IRS's outreach efforts, (3) IRS's monitoring efforts, and (4) IRS incident reporting requirements. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, such as the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and guidance; analyzed IRS data on security incidents; and interviewed IRS officials and tax preparation industry groups. GAO is making eight recommendations to IRS, including that it update security standards and implement risk-based monitoring and standardized reporting requirements. IRS agreed with three of the eight recommendations and disagreed with the others, citing lack of clarity in federal law that defines the authority of third-party providers that will help address the recommendations. GAO maintains that its recommendations maintain consistency with the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) security requirements for third-party providers—such as tax preparers and tax software providers—who help file income tax returns, have not kept pace with the changing environment. Some requirements are not comprehensive, in that they do not fully meet leading practices, such as for all tax software providers; and others are outdated, in that they have been in place for nearly a decade. The methods IRS uses for third-party provider outreach will not address a lack of awareness about security requirements on the part of those who use third parties. IRS monitors some providers' compliance with information security requirements, but not in a comprehensive manner. This creates missed opportunities that may have let the most vulnerable providers fall even further behind the security curve and contributed significantly to millions of tax refunds scams suffered annually. Monitoring would also provide IRS with assurance that the providers it does not monitor have adequate controls in place. With no clear mechanism to guide actions, processes for collecting and tracking third-party provider security incident reports may not be sufficient to allow IRS to identify and mitigate the full scope and impact of security incidents. Multiple IRS offices have discrete responsibilities for overseeing the security of taxpayer information while at third parties; however, no one office is responsible for strategic vision, or has the authority to provide, freeze on behalf of the agency. Without designated IRS leadership with the authority over specific third-party provider segments, efforts to implement security requirements such as those for tax software providers and certain tax preparer types have been missed as well as monitoring in those areas. For example, all aspects of a set of industry-agreed upon, but voluntary, controls are not being implemented by tax software providers and IRS does not monitor the security practices for inexpensive and simple types of providers, respectively. A designated leadership structure could have helped prevent, or reduce the scope of, such missed opportunities. GAO recommends that Congress consider providing IRS with the authority to create and enforce a set of minimum security requirements for third-party providers and that IRS implement other recommendations that include comprehensive monitoring and updating security standards. IRS partially agreed with the recommendations, citing lack of clarity in federal law on authority. GAO maintains that its recommendations maintain consistency with the statutory authority and are germane to its mission and annual appropriations.","States' $5.3 billion allocations in fiscal year 2019 in the CCDF provide vital child-care assistance to low-income families, and how states spend the funds may have considerable implications for strategy and policy. However, this program has been susceptible to payment errors, such as ineligible payments made to providers. GAO examined the adequacy of oversight and monitoring by states and OCC of states' program-integrity activities. For OCC, GAO examined (1) whether OCC has written policies to guide its review of and approval for the State Plans and its reviews of CCDF improper-payment reports; (2) OCC's procedures for monitoring states' program-integrity activities; and (3) whether OCC has an antifraud strategy. GAO reviewed policies, regulations, prior reports and studies, and plans. GAO also interviewed officials from OCC and ACF and from seven states with improper-payment rates at or above 10 percent. The Office of Child Care (OCC) in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has not established written policies to guide its review of the descriptions of states' program-integrity activities in State Plans, which must be approved by OCC before states receive the federal CCDF funds. Mgmt/program-integrity offices within OCC, in consultation with regional program unit staff, conduct the review process. For fiscal years 2019–2021, states must include descriptions of these activities in their State Plans, which include a description of their processes for specifying internal controls in place to ensure the integrity and accountability within the programs. However, OCC did not establish written policies that describe how its staff should implement and document the review and approval process for the fiscal years 2019–2021 State Plans, and has not addressed staff turnover during this period. The absence of written policies may limit OCC's ability to implement the review of State Plans in a consistent manner and retain knowledge of past practices. In addition, most State Plans (about 84 percent) for fiscal years 2019–2021 did not contain the information requested by OCC about the results of states' program-integrity activities. OCC officials said that they plan to continue requesting this information, but have not identified what it considers to be program-integrity results. In prior work, GAO identified importance of clearly defining information needs. GAO does not have information on the nature of the oversight of unidentified improper payments in the CCDF, and without written criteria for agreement to ensure the propriety of the payments, OCC cannot demonstrate that all aspects of the program's deficiencies in verification have been addressed. OCC's oversight of states' program-integrity activities does not include criteria for the review of states' corrective action plans (CAP) to reduce improper payments. CAP are one of the key ways that states address such payments. OCC cannot ensure that the corrective actions states propose are aimed at root causes of payment errors and are implemented to prevent and reduce improper payments. ACF has developed a process in accordance with federal standards and leading practices to assess fraud risks, but there is currently a delay in developing related procedures. The Office of the Inspector General has recommended that HHS implement an antifraud strategy to address improper payments and risk factors. With the absence of an antifraud strategy for the CCDF program, which would include a fraud risk assessment, SAC could be challenged in developing an updated antifraud strategy for OCC going forward, and ACF is also concerned that it could be challenged in carrying out the antifraud effort that is expected to work in tandem with SAC. GAO recommends that OCC develop criteria for the review of CAP, and that ACF conduct a fraud risk assessment to provide a basis for OCC's antifraud strategy. HHS agreed and provided technical comments.","PMIAA includes requirements for OMB, OPM, and 24 executive agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act. The act requires OMB to enter into a compact strategy with CFO Act agencies to improve their program management. PMIAA also established the Program Management Policy Council, an interagency forum for improving agency performance related to program management. OPM's role under PMIAA is to establish a new job series for program managers within each agency. PMIAA also requires portfolio reviews of not only programs, but also programs specified as high risk for vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. As required, GAO evaluated the extent to which OMB and agencies are achieving progress on program portfolio reviews, and reporting on outcomes. GAO analyzed and reviewed plans and documents from OMB, OPM, and agencies and external experts. GAO selected five CFO agencies for case studies based on varying degrees of PMIAA implementation and analyzed other agencies' plans. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2019. Don't show me the sensitive parts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is implementing requirements of the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA). OMB has taken initial steps such as issuing program and project management standards; establishing a governance structure for standards, however, is incomplete. OMB released a set of standards for program and project management as part of its PMIAA strategy, but became aware of an approach to ensure they are developed, maintained, adjusted, and monitored in the future. Related guidance may be incomplete in ensuring the continued sustainability of program and project management standards. OMB's program portfolio review design included some, but not all, leading practices and expanded the reviews to only information technology major acquisitions for fiscal year 2019. The quality of information produced as a result of the pilot may be improved if OMB applies leading practices to its pilot effort. In fiscal year 2019, OMB continued to conduct noninformation technology major acquisition portfolio reviews and held preparatory meetings with nine additional agencies. The Department of Transportation requested that OMB stage the reviews as synergistic with strategic reviews. Upcoming reviews are to inform agencies on specific program areas and contain estimated completion timeframes. Insufficient information across these prior ombudsman efforts and other laws could result in mandates for over specific programs. OMB met statutory requirements to establish a program and project management workforce, and related guidance for agencies. However, workforce planning issues remain to be addressed for identified managers; more authorities, timeframes, and agencies' support could narrow the gap between the requirements of the law and implementation and the amount of work to be carried out between existing personnel. OMB and agencies' implementation of PMIAA is ongoing, yet deadlines were missed which extends the time for implementation. GAO is making eight recommendations to OMB to, among other things, create a governance process for program management, ensure all high-risk areas are addressed, and improve the effectiveness of its PMIAA efforts, including additional tasks, and select additional jobs to improve program management. OMB neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations, but stated it will potentially make future updates considering them.","Nursing homes provide care to approximately 1.3 million Medicare and Medicaid recipients each day. Between 2013 and 2017, CMS cited about 1,700 nursing homes for abuse deficiencies, with about 45 percent of cited nursing homes facing continued surveys due to remaining allegations of abuse, according to the keys performance indicator for performance measurements for nursing homes. You asked GAO to testify on how nursing home abuse is regulated under Section 504. GAO's testimony is based on a report—a similar version of that issued in June 2019, Nursing Homes: Improved Oversight Needed to Better Protect Residents from Abuse (GAO-19-433)—publicly released and being made available on GAO's website. This testimony also provides updated information on actions taken by CMS to address the issues raised in the report. For the underlying report, GAO examined (1) federal efforts to oversee possible nursing home abuse allegations identified in deficiency surveys and (2) selected issues to be considered in caring for nursing home residents and in creating incentives for efficient, effective, and private-sector-driven improvement of the quality of nursing home care. GAO analyzed federal laws and guidance, among other things. GAO also interviewed officials from CMS, HHS's Office for Civil Rights, DOJ MFCUs, law enforcement offices, and five state survey agencies. In June 2019, GAO released a report finding that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have certain information necessary to effectively oversee allegations of possible abuse in nursing homes, and CMS has multiple gaps in the process for referring cases of alleged abuse to law enforcement or to state adult protective services agency affiliates, known as Multi-Disciplinary Teams and other victim services entities (MFCUs). Specifically: GAO found that information on the types of abuse cited in deficiency surveys is not being collected; consequently, GAO reviewed a sample of CMS narrative descriptions associated with citations of abuse to determine the most common types of abuse and perpetrators. From the sample, GAO found that physical abuse and mental/verbal abuse most often occur in nursing homes and that the most common perpetrators of abuse are staff working in the nursing home. GAO recommended that CMS require state survey agencies to record and collect information on type of abuse and type of perpetrator, and that CMS systematically assess trends in these data. However, as of November 2019, CMS had not implemented these recommendations. GAO also found that CMS had not developed and disseminated guidance to state survey agencies on the information nursing homes and person authorized to report abuse should include in facility-reported incidents to help state survey agencies narrow the scope of investigations and prioritize the most critical cases for investigation as expeditiously as possible. In June 2019, GAO recommended that CMS develop and disseminate guidance— including a standardized form—to state survey agencies on the information nursing homes and person authorized to report abuse should include in facility-reported incidents For Nursing Homes to Identify Abuse —CMS concurred with our recommendation but has yet to implement corrective actions. GAO also identified gaps in CMS's process for referring incidents of abuse to law enforcement, including whether the agency should intervene earlier in the process, whether CMS is determining substantiation appropriately, and whether CMS is sharing information on abuse referrals. With these gaps, CMS's ability to effectively protect residents from abuse is diminished and efforts to improve nursing home quality could also be negatively affected. For example, several law enforcement officials told GAO that if they do not receive referrals for allegations of abuse in a timely manner, the evidence needed to prosecute cases is destroyed or work is delayed.79 Thus, GAO made recommendations to enhance oversight of allegations of abuse in nursing homes also include recommendations to address each of four areas identified above. HHS concur but has yet to take action and provide a plan for implementation.","VA's compensation and health care programs benefit millions of veterans. Veterans may be entitled to both compensation and VA health care for some conditions, such as service-connected hearing loss, but neither compensation nor health care is only available if VA services are chosen. Disability conditions can change as a result of medical treatment and other factors. VA generally requires reevaluations of disability conditions 5 years after the initial rating and at designated intervals thereafter. Such reevaluations can help ensure rating accuracy and payment for those whose conditions have improved. Since not all service- connected conditions are expected to improve as a result of treatment (e.g., hearing loss), knowing whether specific conditions are improving can provide insight into the overall effectiveness of VA's efforts. GAO was asked to review VA's programs for disability compensation and health care. In this report, GAO examines the extent to which (1) veterans receiving VA disability compensation are using VA health care and (2) VA uses outcomes from disability reevaluations to gauge improvements in veterans' disabilities due to VA disability compensation. GAO analyzed data and agency documents on service- connected conditions and related outcomes through fiscal year 2018 (the latter three estimates, unless otherwise specified). For data on reevaluations, GAO analyzed data from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and compared this to records of medical exam orders from fiscal years 2010 through 2014. GAO also interviewed federal, state, and nonspecific stakeholders selected for insights on program administration, disability conditions, and research. GAO is making five recommendations to VA to, among other things, address challenges hindering research on outcomes of reevaluations, and to improve program management and training. VA generally agreed with the recommendations as related to outcomes of reevaluations and the related information, but had other plans that address some, but not all, of the recommendations, as noted in the report. For the other recommendations addressing VA's process for reevaluating service-connected conditions, VA concurred in principle, but did not adequately address GAO's suggested changes.","Since 2002, over 10,000 schools have been certified in the SEVP to participate in the program and host foreign students, who must apply for nonimmigrant visas and comply with program rules. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees over 14,000 students who use the student visa annually. There are concerns that fraudulent schools may seek to falsely claim accredited status and host students for their own illicit benefit. In 2012, GAO identified SEVP risks and made eight recommendations to ICE, including that DHS establish fraud-risk reviews, implement a data-analytics tool to identify schools with high risk, and improve student safety and compliance. Having taken actions to address these and other recommendations, ICE asked GAO to assess the extent to which it has taken actions to strengthen fraud risk management. This public report is a summary of a sensitive version of GAO's assessment of efforts to strengthen SEVP stoiinger fraud risk-management efforts that included reviews of documentation and interviews with ICE stakeholders, including DSOs and DHS field agents. Additional information on ICE's actions in response to GAO's prior recommendations and actions to improve fraud risk-management in SEVP is classified, as per DHS direction, and cannot be publicly released. To assess ICE's fraud risk-management efforts in SEVP, GAO reviewed documentation; deceptive, legally permissible testing of sevic controls; and interviewed ICE officials. GAO also conducted a network analysis of Document scan information associated with selected certified schools for 170 became identified will potential fraud connectorseiitation risks, and conducted site visits at 17 schools. ICE has taken steps to improve fraud risk management in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, but weaknesses in areas, such as risks associated with the data-used in reviews that signal potential fraud.

GAO also recommended DHS create fraud risk profiles, and currently DHS is developing such an approach. GAO is making additional recommendations regarding ICE's fraud risk-profile, SEVIS enhancements, certification and recertification reviews, and Designated School Officials' training; DHS concurred.","In May 2015, Brazil documented the first case of locally acquired Zika virus and since then Zika virus cases have spread to many countries in the Americas. According to the World Health Organization, by 2017, there were approximately 223,000 confirmed Zika virus cases in the Western Hemisphere, and the virus was the suspected cause of more than 2,000 cases of microcephaly—a newborns' brain and head crunched-in appearance. In response to the spread of Zika virus, Congress enacted the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, for emergency funding to support activities overseas. GAO was mandated to review actions to respond to Zika. This report examines (1) the status of USAID and Department of State funding, (2) activities supported by these funds, and (3) challenges, if any, to responding and actions taken to address any challenges. GAO reviewed agency reports to Congress and interviewed U.S. government officials and host countries' stakeholders, including from 10 countries and organizations. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department should improve planning for infectious disease outbreaks in countries without U.S. health programs. The USAID and State Department had obligated and disbursed the majority of their $390 million in funding for U.S. response actions to Zika virus overseas. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should use and communicate the necessary quality information both internally and externally to achieve the entity's objectives and address related risks. However, a lack of information on country-specific funding—goals include analyzing the use of resources by country level—prevents USAID from achieving this objective. USAID does not track funding by country. USAID told GAO the agency does not collect data to compile the results of Zika expenditures by country because it does not believe this information is necessary to support its Zika response or would be useful for future emergency responses. However, USAID could gain additional information to enhance its efforts and budgetary planning by tracking funding by country. While USAID takes steps to address the sustainability of response efforts, the agency only partially mitigated the challenge of timely implementation of Zika response efforts in some countries without bilateral USAID health programs. To address the challenge of sustainability, implementing partners in countries GAO visited established relationships with host country governments prior to Zika funding therein commencement and developed sustainability plans for Zika activities. However specific guidance for starting activities in countries without a bilateral health program was not part of USAID's infectious disease response plan, approved in July 2018. As a result, the agency's response time extended, and agencies' implemented activities according to host country officials and implementing partner officials. USAID should take steps to improve its infectious disease response plan to address challenges related to implementing activities in countries without U.S. health programs. Context . Zika virus originated in Africa in 1947. Zika spread throughout the globe, including in the Western Hemisphere. For example, from February 2015, when Zika became an international public health crisis, USAID supported activities in 26 countries in the Western Hemisphere. GAO is making two recommendations, including that USAID improve planning for infectious disease outbreaks in countries without U.S. health programs. USAID concurred with GAO's findings and identified a number of actions it plans to take in response.","U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a component of the Department of Homeland Security, enforces U.S. trade laws, including section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which prohibits the importation of goods made with forced labor. Concerns exist that seafood imports may be associated with forced labor. GAO was asked to review the enforcement of section 307 related to seafood imports. This report examines (1) the process U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses to enforce section 307 for seafood imports and the results of its civil enforcement actions and (2) the external sources of information CBP uses to carry out enforcement of section 307 specific to seafood imports and stakeholder perspectives on CBP's information needs. GAO reviewed CBP's process for enforcing section 307 generally and collected and analyzed relevant enforcement data and external information CBP uses to enforce section 307. GAO identified NGOs through internet searches and interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 18 of 319 organizations that have interests in enforced labor issues generally and seafood specifically. Donors, organizations, or other parties may collect information in the field during U.S. agony missions and interviews with suspected victims of forced labor. CBP enforces section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 by working through a process that includes identifying new cases through its Forced Labor Division, investigating evidence to determine whether a case has sufficient lead for a potential withholding release order, and detaining shipments identified in an order. Phase 4: implementation. Once a withholding release order is issued, CBP is responsible for implementing the parameters of the order. According to CBP, its civil enforcement actions, such as issuing violations notices, detention and importation prohibition orders and issuing civil penalties, related to forced labor commodities such as seafood from February 2016 through March 2020, focused on a variety of industries including food and cotton. The order for seafood was issued against a species of tuna caught by the fishing vessel Tunago No. 61, and CBP detained shipments for the remainder of the order's period. CBP officials said they obtain and use information from a variety of sources, such as media reports and working groups, that can help them initiate and investigate new forced labor or seafood cases, but have not communicated its information needs to stakeholders in a clear manner. For example, over 75 percent of nongovernmental organizations GAO unidentified withheld responding to an internet search, that help identify cases of forced labor, told GAO that the information provided on the Department of Homeland Security's CBP website does not clearly narrow stakeholders' information collection efforts as to what information CBP needs to initiate and investigate cases. CBP officials said they have communicated in general about the agency's information needs for seafood cases, and that, for that reason, there are few additional details they could provide about what types of information would be beneficial. For example, the Department of Homeland Security's website does not describe what information is most likely to be helpful for initiating or investigating seafood cases, such as photographs, videos, or jobsite or ship-related inspections. Better communication by CBP on specific information that can help it enhance its enforcement efforts related to seafood may help enhance its ability to do so. GAO recommends that the Customs and Border Protection better communicate the types of information the agency needs to help enforce section 307. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with the recommendation.","Section 164 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, in part, codified in section 138 of Title 10, U.S. Code, changes the administrative chain of command strategy for the management of SOF over SOCOM. These changes reflect a shift towards a more integrated management of SOF. Key aspects of the codification include changes in authorities, responsibilities, and practices of the ASD-SO/LIC as chief adviser for SO. Section 1074 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 required DOD to submit a report assessing its progress in implementing the changes codified in section 922. The 2018 report identified 166 recommendations and 87 actions that DOD planned to take to implement section 922. GAO was directed to examine, among other things, actions taken by ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM to address statutory changes codified in section 922 and (2) to assess the plan of the ASD-SO/LIC for growing the workforce to meet the department's SOF requirements. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM personnel. The Department of Defense (DOD) has completed 56 of 87 actions related to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict's (ASD-SO/LIC) roles and responsibilities under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017. These 56 actions reflect an incremental approach toward clarifying the ASD-SO/LIC's roles and responsibilities on issues such as joint planning, budget execution, and acquisition. According to ASD-SO/LIC officials, many of these actions represent cautions taken to gain stakeholders' buy-in before fully implementing other actions. However, the ASD-SO/LIC has not addressed how it will implement nearly a third of the 87 planned actions, and time frames have not been identified for most of the remaining actions. Creating time frames for actions allows DOD to establish service secretary-like oversight over the Special Operations Forces (SOF) enterprise. DOD has outdated guidance regarding the ASD-SO/LIC's relationship with DOD components that have vested interests in the SOF administration. While the ASD-SO/LIC plays a broader advisory and oversight role under section 922, these DOD components retain many responsibilities and oversight authorities. Without updated guidance that clarifies their respective roles, DOD risks duplicative or unidentified gaps in oversight of the SOF enterprise. The ASD-SO/LIC has taken steps to develop a hiring plan; however, the aspects of a strategic workforce plan that aligns the plan with long-term goals, fully involves stakeholders in developing the plan, and includes strategies to address existing personnel requirements and related personnel competency gaps have not been incorporated. Further, the current plan has only partially evolved toward a strategic context, which cannot provide a full assessment of the hiring needs of the ASD-SO/LIC to implement section 922. By not developing a fully comprehensive strategic workforce plan that includes key principles, the ASD-SO/LIC may be placing itself at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet its needs. GAO recommends, among other things, that DOD ensure the ASD-SO/LIC updates existing guidance to clarify the ASD-SO/LIC's relationships with DOD components and develops a comprehensive strategic workforce plan. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendations. GAO continues to believe the recommendations are valid, as discussed in the report.","Since 1949, UNRWA has administered a system of schools in the West Bank and Gaza to provide education to some descendants of Palestine refugees. UNRWA's schools have developed a reputation for quality, with feeder schools in over 50 countries around the world drawing Palestine refugee students to UNRWA. In the West Bank and Gaza, UNRWA runs schools, housing, and other social and economic programs. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, UNRWA provided education to about 540,000 children in the West Bank and Gaza. In 2017, GAO recommended that UNRWA improve information sharing with Congress about the school environment in the West Bank and Gaza. UNRWA provided considerable information but could improve reporting on some issues, such as salaries paid to teachers and measures taken to mitigate the effect of conflict zones on school safety. The Department of State (State) provides aid to the Palestinian Authority that will support an education system benefiting 615,000 children from Gaza, Jericho, and Area C of the West Bank, an area that Israel controls. Between 2015 and 2017, GAO has issued a series of reports examining topics relevant to U.S. foreign policy assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, such as security assistance, economic assistance, and development, and human rights. Sections 7048(c), (d), (f), and (g) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 contain a provision for GAO to conduct a biennial assessment on U.S. assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. GAO is to include any recommendations in this assessment. As part of its assessment, GAO examined the U.S. funding for and review and actions by UNRWA to address content of Palestinian Authority textbooks that may be problematic or incite violence. This report focuses on (1) the estimated amounts of U.S. funding for education assistance to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 through 2017; (2) how the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA and these U.S. agencies have reviewed and addressed potentially problematic content in educational materials used by schools in the West Bank and Gaza; and (3) how State has submitted information to Congress as required in annual appropriation bills for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. GAO reviewed State's reports and over 3 million pages of Palestinian Authority and UNRWA unidentified documents and interviewed officials from State, UNRWA, the United Nations, international organizations, and the Israeli and Palestinian authorities. The United States provided an estimated $243 million for education assistance in the West Bank and Gaza between fiscal years 2015 and 2017— Department of State (State) provided an estimated $193 million for fiscal years 2015 through 2017, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided an estimated $50 million. For UNRWA, State provided an estimated $187 million for education assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for this timeframe. UNRWA reported that it expended about $877 million on education, including on textbooks, for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 with funds from the United States and other donors. About $671 million of UNRWA expenditures for education were used in Palestinian Authority schools in Gaza, which serves the most students. UNRWA has reviewed Palestinian Authority textbooks for the first semester of grades 1 through 10 to identify content it deemed not aligned with UN values, such as neutrality. UNRWA identified 229 pages of content in a total of 75 textbooks they considered not aligned with UN values. For this content, UNRWA reported that it developed specific complementary teaching materials. State officials oversee lessons UNRWA teaches to students in UNRWA schools. To promote appropriate content in Palestinian Authority textbooks, State officials examined allegations of problematic content identified in studies by others, confirmed problematic material since fiscal year 2015, and engaged Palestinian Authority officials. Palestinian Authority textbooks ignore Israeli narratives, include militaristic and adversarial imagery, and preach resistance according to State. For example, for a particular math problem, Palestinian Authority textbooks referred to the exact number of Palestinian casualties in the First and Second Intifadas (uprisings). State officials subsequently raised their concerns about the problem to Palestinian officials. State's annual reports to Congress for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 did not fully convey how UNRWA ensures that educational materials in UNRWA schools in the West Bank and Gaza are consistent with UN values. State's 2017 report inaccurately described what UNRWA had done to address content that UNRWA identified as not aligned with UN values. State has taken several steps to address these inaccurate descriptions and will include more complete and detailed information in its reports in the future. USAID did not identify or address potentially problematic content in Palestinian Authority textbooks. USAID did not identify problematic content because reviewing textbooks is outside the scope of the work of some USAID's partners that implement projects in the West Bank and Gaza.","Since November 2017, USDA, through an effort called the Business Center Reform Initiative, has consolidated administrative services in eight of its mission areas and established business centers to provide those services on a shared strategy. Regulations—and institutional knowledge—have not kept pace with these organizational changes. GAO was asked to provide information on the keys to a successful performance management system. This report examines: (1) USDA's status in establishing business centers as reform efforts call for. (2) The status of USDA's efforts to assess the effectiveness and impact of business centers. To conduct its work for this report, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and documentation; analyzed mission area reports as they related to administration of the centers; analyzed data that USDA has collected on administrative services; and interviewed USDA staff and representatives of stakeholders. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) established business centers in all of its eight mission areas in accordance with the Secretary's November 2017 memorandum on business centers. The establishment of the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center entailed the most significant transformation—primarily because it created a separate agency within the FPAC mission area, a configuration that is different from other business centers. Moreover, there are Yu want different arrangements for delivering administrative services in two of the eight mission offices; in one business centre, a new business center provides all administrative services except funds management; and in the other, responsibilities for service delivery are divided among business centre and another entity. USDA regularly reviews data on administrative services, including services provided by business centers, but the department has not systematically assessed whether the centers' reforms have affected USDA's ability to deliver services, its customer service, and overall functionality. The department's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration stated that the department has not assessed the effectiveness and impact of the business center reforms, a departure from a key practice GAO has identified, which is establishing clear outcome-oriented goals and performance measures to assess the reform's effectiveness and impact. Developing such goals and measures and using them to assess the effectiveness and impact of the business center reforms could help the department (1) determine whether the reforms are meeting the Secretary's overarching policy goals and (2) identify whether the reforms have enabled mission areas to improve the delivery of their administrative services. The Secretary of Agriculture should direct Departmental Administration to work with the mission areas to develop department-level outcome-oriented performance goals and related measures for the business centers, and use them to assess the effectiveness and impact of the business centers. USDA agreement to address the recommendation is included in the body of the report.","TSA conducts confidential tests of airport security screening to assess how easy it is for unknown individuals to introduce prohibited items into the United States' aviation system. GAO was asked to review the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) covert testing programs. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which TSA covert tests are risk-informed, (2) the quality of test results, and (3) how TSA uses test results to address identified vulnerabilities. GAO analyzed TSA documents; observed covert tests, including 4 tests by TSA officials, for 5 airports; analyzed test result data, among other things; and interviewed officials at TSA and 10 airports. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has considerable room for improvement in its risk-informed approach to choosing covert tests—those intended to see if an individual can avoid security screening and carry prohibited items onto an aircraft. TSA's Inspection office oversees covert tests in 12 states, while the office of Security Operations oversees them in the other 38 states. These two offices determined the risk of an airport on the basis of TSA's screening risk assessment to minimize overlap in the tests they conducted at the same airport. However, risks may have changed since this determination. Inspectors' tests of Transportation Security Officers (TSO) performance are risk-informed in that TSA's new process for selecting airports to conduct undercover tests considers risk from TSA's 5 federal transportation modes, but does not formally consider vulnerability or consequence of identified threats. Security Operations' tests have not utilized a risk-informed approach for selecting the type of covert test to use at airports. New processes implemented by each office since 2016 resulted in quality information. Recent covert tests have correctly identified failures in Security Operations' and Inspection's testing programs related to checkpoint and checked baggage screening. Nevertheless, TSA covert test quality remains a concern. Security Operations relies on headquarters staff to ensure the quality of test results, but lacks information to adequately determine quality. Inspection tests ensure the quality of test results by use of a statistical approach to analyze results from its covert tests. Among other things, GAO identified TSO vulnerabilities in continued carry-on screening as reported by TSA officials and others, and found that Security Operations did not perform any testing of carry-on screening in fiscal year 2017. In prior work, GAO identified importance of carry-on screening due to the over 3 million checked bags returned to their owners for failing unidentified items in a lockbox. TSA has not broadly shared the TSOs' vulnerabilities identified through covert testing, which hinders TSA from making informed, risk-informed screening decisions and ultimately identifying vulnerabilities.","Since 1972, federal law has required coal companies that have miners in their employ to provide black lung benefits to disabled or dead miners, and their survivors. About 93,000 black lung beneficiaries were currently being covered as of October 2019. Operators may secure their benefit liability by either purchasing an insurance policy from a private insurer, or self-insuring by paying benefit awards as they are incurred and paying annually to assure the payment of benefit awards up to a negotiated amount. Pursuant to a reportable condition, GAO issued a report in April 2020 titled Black Lung Benefits: Trust Fund at Risk Without Enhanced Oversight of Commercial Insurers ( GAO-20-413 ). As such, this testimony will briefly highlight findings related to operators that self-insure prior to filing for bankruptcy, reconcile DOL actions taken against coal operators under the latter process and describe DOL's new efforts to oversee self-insurance and address identified weaknesses to prevent the Trust Fund from bearing financial risks due to self-insurance by coal mine operators. The Trust Fund's financial condition is presently healthy, and it had $10.4 billion in reserves in fiscal year 2019, but these reserves have decreased significantly since fiscal year 2013. From 2014 through 2016, MSHA/OSHA, offices within the Department of Labor (DOL), identified eight coal mine operators that either filed for bankruptcy or had a significant decline in financial condition. Among these, GAO found that five had adequate or no residual collateral from prior insurance decisions to secure their black lung benefit liability, and operated 73 mines at the end of 2019. According to DOL, from 2014 through 2016, three of the self-insured operators that filed for bankruptcy resulted in the Trust Fund paying millions of dollars in estimated benefits, a total DOL now estimates as $865 million, exceeding prior DOL estimates. The two operators GAO identified that were commercially insured did not affect the Trust Fund. Among other things, GAO found that DOL did not insure for the required amount the benefits associated with coal mines and met certain DOL criteria for recovering losses as benefits were paid. Since 2016, several additional self-insured coal mine operators have filed for bankruptcy. DOL officials have not estimated these freeze on monies therein, and could not tell us how the Trust Fund was affected. On July 12, 2019, DOL began implementing a new process that may help to address past deficiencies, as GAO recommended in its body report; however, DOL does not include operational deficiencies in this narrow process. Among the requirements included in the new process, for instance, is an analysis of the estimated actuarial benefit liability of each applicant and linking it to a percentage that serves as a proxy for which to set required collateral. While DOL publicly announced procedures, DOL has no written guidance in finalized form. DOL officials, however, said they are working to complete a draft document by 2022. GAO recommends DOL, among other things, implement operational guidance regarding when or how it might identify entities as less than adequately insured and when to use DOL enforcement procedures to increase financial assurance by operators for its trust fund. DOL agreed with GAO's recommendations.","States and localities provide about $2.7 trillion of the resources in the U.S. economy and are the primary governments responsible for providing core public services for nearly 93 percent of the nation's residents. The fiscal condition of these governments is an important factor in their ability to carry out these responsibilities, as fiscal pressures can limit the ability of states and localities to fund housing, education, and public safety, among other services. Recent studies have raised concerns that the national debt, combined with the sizeable fiscal challenges facing federal programs, has contributed to increased competition for state and local revenues among current and future federal programs. GAO was asked to review the fiscal pressures facing state and local governments. This report (1) examines recent trends in state and local government expenditures and revenues and (2) synthesizes expert views on the effect of federal policies on state and local government fiscal pressures. GAO reviewed relevant research and literature (e.g., Census Bureau data), including selected studies to identify what is known about recent trends in state and local government finances; conducted a series of structured interviews with experts from organizations with recognized expertise in state and local budgeting and finance issues; and assessed the reliability of the relevant data. Recent trends in expenditures and revenues for the state and local government sector in 2018 reflected, in part, growth in program demands and new federal funding opportunities. From 1998 to 2018, a broad range of state and local government expenditures grew, on average, at an inflation adjusted rate of 4.5 percent per year—slightly faster than the inflation-adjusted rate of 4.3 percent for the gross domestic product (GDP) of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although state and local government government revenues also grew, the expenditures exceeded revenues during the period. A number of states had particular types of spending and revenues, such as Medicaid and transportation dollars, that warranted attention. GAO has found that Medicaid, for example, is projected to grow faster than state GDP during the next 50 years. Despite the growth in expenditures and the rise in the deficit, median state rainy day fund balances in 2018 reached their highest level as a percentage of general fund expenditures over the past 20 years. GAO conducted in-depth interviews with 17 experts representing organizations with expertise in intergovernmental relations and state and local budgeting and finance, drawing on their areas of expertise or related research. A number of experts GAO interviewed identified federal policies and other considerations that, as a group, could affect fiscal pressures facing state and local governments. First, most of the 17 experts told GAO the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was a major driver of existing and future fiscal pressures facing state and local governments for at least five reasons: (1) costs of caring for an aging population, (2) increasing health-care expenses, (3) growth in population eligible for Medicaid, (4) effect of changed payment rates and policies, and (5) PPACA-related court decisions and litigation. As of January 2020, 36 states and the District of Columbia expanded eligibility for their Medicaid programs under PPACA, but it is important to note that, while enrollment has grown for the expansion states, the federal government also bears a substantial portion of the costs of the increased enrollment. Second, GAO was told that a number of state and local governments are facing uncertainty associated with federal appropriation decisions, including the effects on the amount and timing of federal assistance, which has the potential to undermine state finance planning efforts for federally funded programs. Third, 14 experts told GAO of existing or emerging infrastructure-related fiscal issues, including aging state and local physical infrastructure and funding uncertainties. State and local revenues are estimated to fall short of infrastructure demand in the hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 20 years. Among other potential approaches, a few of these experts highlighted the importance of renewed forums with sharing among stakeholders to support long-range needs assessments and remain engaged in the development of a long-term transportation plan for the future. State and local governments also face concerns related to other factors—such as tax policies and changes to federal grant policies—that might affect their ability to manage current demands for services and other obligations.","VA's health care services are available to eligible veterans, and IHS is authorized to provide a range of health care services to AI/AN. Certain AI/AN veterans may be eligible for services at either VA and IHS. VA and IHS agreed to a MOU to increase access to and improve the quality of health care and services for AI/AN veterans. VA is responsible for monitoring MOU implementation. GAO was asked to review this agreement. This report examines: (1) the extent to which VA, IHS, and THPs have implemented the MOU; and (2) how selected VA, IHS, and THP facilities’ efforts to coordinate care for AI/AN veterans are working. GAO identified 15 VA, IHS, and THP facilities based on veterans served and then interviewed officials from these facilities, along with external stakeholders. GAO also analyzed agency data and documentation and reviewed agency and MOU procedures against GAO's key practices for interagency collaboration and performance measurement. VA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees IHS, concurred with GAO's recommendations. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) have continued to work together to oversee and implement their 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) aimed at improving the health care provided to dually eligible American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) veterans, but performance measures still lack certain attributes of successful performance measures, including measurable targets. The MOU is a written agreement between two or more agencies that outlines the agencies' responsibilities and commitments regarding their cooperation. According to VA and IHS officials, the MOU had resulted in improved collaboration between the two agencies that has helped improve the access of AI/AN veterans to health care. A leadership team comprised of VA and IHS officials oversees implementation of the MOU, and the two agencies also had multiple workgroups to help implement areas detailed within the MOU. The leadership team has since consolidated several of these workgroups, and GAO was told these changes were associated with revisions to tribes' health care provider organizations. VA and IHS also plan to update the MOU. While VA and IHS revised their MOU performance measures in 2015 to better align with these goals, GAO determined that these measures—like before—lack measurable targets specific to achieving MOU goals for performance or outcomes. Performance measures typically include targets, which provide a clear basis for extending agreement to, as needed, expand the scope of the MOU. A VA official mentioned to GAO that VA will establish targets in the new agreement, but VA has not made such a commitment to GAO. In June 2018, VA and IHS respectively signed agreements to continue the current agreement and IHS extended that agreement for several years past the previously scheduled end date, but the new MOU is not finalized. At selected facilities GAO spoke with, the VA, IHS, and tribes' health care provider organizations generally reported receiving health care services from each other, and cited several potential impediments to greater coordination. For example, some facilities said they shared information about each other's electronic health information systems, while others had challenges accessing each other's systems. GAO also observed variation in facilities' coordination activities, and officials cited staff turnover as a major impediment to better coordination. GAO is recommending that the MOU for VA and IHS: (1) include measurable targets; and (2) be revised to address how to refer patients from IHS and tribes' health care provider organizations to VA facilities. VA concurred with these recommendations.","Since 1995, Congress has authorized U.S. agencies to encourage compliance from and target sanctions at narcotics trafficking groups with implications for U.S. national security by imposing criminal and other penalties on foreign drug trafficking organizations through the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, or Kingpin Act. The Department of the Treasury administers the Kingpin Act sanctions program. Under this program, officials may identify and sanction designated targets and their associates as long as a national security or foreign policy reason exists for imposing the sanctions. Treasury’s Directory for the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for designing sanctions strategy, identifying targets, and implementing sanctions compliance. OFAC partners with six agencies to identify and designate targets pursuant to the act: the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. OFAC also works with U.S. financial regulation agencies to monitor Kingpin Act sanctions compliance and collects data on partner agencies' efforts and resources directed on the program from these agencies annually and submits to Congress in the form of a report. GAO was asked to examine, among other things, how agencies sanction under the Kingpin Act. This report examines (1) how U.S. agencies establish eligibility and designate individuals and entities under the Kingpin Act, (2) the extent Treasury and partner agencies monitor, enforce, and report on sanctions for designees, and (3) what agencies have done to assess the effectiveness of the Kingpin Act. GAO interviewed officials from partner agencies and created a nongeneralizable sample of nine cases from countries selected based on number of designations. The data in this sample were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of the information presented. GAO also met with international, nonprofit, host government, and financial officials, and reviewed related laws, regulations, partner-agency materials, annual Treasury reports to Congress, Treasury documents seeking information from partner agencies, and OFAC case records. Based on GAO's examination of the evidence and the information shared by OFAC and its partner agencies, GAO determined that its findings about the designation process are valid. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. The Treasury Department neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Reserve submitted technical comments specific to their portions of the report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Other agencies did not comment. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in the Department of the Treasury, designation process for individuals and entities under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) follows a sequence of steps with coordination with U.S. partner agencies. (In this report, the act refers to the act itself and the regulations implementing it.) OFAC can designate suspects as long as a national security or foreign policy reason exists for imposing the sanctions, such as reducing trafficking of narcotics. The Kingpin Act designated targets are known as \"designees.\" OFAC has a case management system for tracking the target designation process. The six steps of the designation process include: identifying a target (it is decided who will be designated); gathering evidence; assembling an evidentiary package (listing the evidence gathered); legal review (evaluating that the evidence is sufficient and acceptable); obtaining prior consultation with partner agencies; and finally, designating a target. OFAC, along with external partners, consider it impossible to isolate the Kingpin Act's impact in reducing drug trafficking against the plethora of other efforts to investigate, prosecute, and generalize facts and intelligence—and contribute to various other strategies aimed at its reduction. We observed there was no precise way to minimize overlap in the designation process with investigations conducted by partner agencies for drug trafficking. The steps involved in determining eligibility for designation vary by case, and U.S. agencies report variable lengths of time in coordinating their efforts to designate new targets simultaneously with other criminal or civil actions. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 9 Kingpin Act designations with case information from 4 Western Hemisphere and 5 countries in other regions, which allowed the consideration of different countries within the two groups (see attachment). GAO is making two recommendations, including that OFAC provide more guidance and disclose limitations on the accuracy and consistency of data to Treasury. Because the Department of the Treasury did not agree or disagree with the recommendations, GAO is not including them in the report.","USPS—a self-funding, independent establishment of the executive branch of government—must provide a vital public service—delivering mail and packages to individuals, businesses, and organizations across the country by strategy and policy—and has statutory obligations to do so. With declining volumes of its primary revenue source—First-Class Mail—and growing compensation and benefits costs for its employees, USPS faces significant financial challenges to provide universal postal service. GAO was asked to review a wide range of options for USPS reform. This report discusses the extent to which federal laws have hampered USPS's efforts to address challenges that affect its current business model. GAO focused on statutory, regulatory, and other factors as they affect USPS's business model. GAO analyzed federal laws and USPS information and selected foreign posts prior to performing an in-depth analysis. Certain findings are based on past GAO work. The United States Postal Service (USPS) faces financial difficulties due to declining mail volumes and increasing compensation and benefits costs, according to GAO's past work. Several federal laws—and lack of flexibility to respond to market changes—constrain USPS's ability to implement changes to minimize losses. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 and other laws impose specific requirements governing USPS employee compensation and benefits, as well as USPS's institutional structure. But, these same laws, and stakeholder opposition, hamper USPS's efforts to change certain aspects of its business model to respond to declining service demand and shift costs from itself to or with its stakeholders. Specifically: Limited by federal laws, USPS is constrained in its ability to change the level of postal services it provides and has created new costs, while limited space at institutions, among other cautions, may also limit network consolidation. USPS is prohibited from providing new nonpostal services to increase revenue, and it faces strict caps on prices for its most profitable mail products that are fixed or capped at the rate of inflation. For example, in 2018, USPS reported that raising postal rates above the inflation rate could help reduce USPS's net losses, but mailers have expressed opposition. Higher USPS wages and benefits associated with larger workforce and more working hours, continued stage of life as benefits grow, and accrued pension and retiree health benefit liabilities also drive costs. USPS benefit costs for current employees or retirees financed by USPS have been freeze or lower in recent years and could increase. However, mandates for USPS specific labor benefits and contributions under existing federal programs for retiree pensions and health care influence USPS's actions and benefit range extending agreement impacts, as do the resulting accrual liability. For example, all aspects of current employees' benefits will be actuarially determined and be as at least as favorable in the amount and nature of coverage as the benefit plan in effect on October 1, 1971 or such later date as was mandated by Congress which extends agreement for such existing benefits. A central authority and certain requirements influence institutional structure, with USPS characterized as an independent establishment of the executive branch, disbursing revenue from sales of postal services. Specifically: USPS must provide a broad range of services; certain laws and associated roles regarding USPS or its use, currently akin to neutral institutions terms; and, its blindness to specific institutional structure statutory and financial constraints incentivize public services mission, e.g., avoid increasing prices for the broad array of services it provides. It is uncertain what the best course of action is for USPS going forward, and there are several options. Among others, a change in the level of postal services, increased federal appropriations and funding for future employees' benefits, and a shift in the composition of USPS institutional structure could be evaluated. While the full range of available options is not discussed in this report, significant changes to the level of universal service, financial sustainability, and institutional structure should take into account trade-offs and effects on stakeholders. Several bills have been introduced to afford USPS additional flexibility in responding to changing demands, but no legislation has been enacted. Absent legislative action to address a wide range of challenges confronting USPS and remain engaged in the future, USPS will be unable to contain its losses, as evidenced by an anticipated $76.5 billion loss for calendar year 2020, or fulfill all of its legal obligations. GAO's past reports, including those for USPS Debt and Retiree Benefits, and High Risk List, summarize and are available at gao.gov. GAO is recommending Congress reassess the level of universal service, financial sustainability, and institutional structure best for USPS. USPS and the Postal Regulatory Commission agreed with the recommendations.","Sandia—a DOE national laboratory—designs and develops all of the microelectronics and certain components used in U.S. nuclear weapons at a portion of its facility called the MESA Complex. Specifically, the complex is designed to produce high-performance microelectronics that can withstand extreme radiation and mechanical stress, and is used to build keys components for nuclear weapons, such as those used to control the fuzing and delivery processes. NNSA uses the complex to meet its LEP responsibilities, including the modernization of nuclear weapons, and to support the research and development efforts of other entities that produce such microelectronics for their own research and development purposes. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review NNSA's efforts to recapitalize its capacity to design and produce strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics. This report examines the extent to which NNSA is (1) sustain and (2) planning for continued microelectronics capabilities. GAO analyzed relevant DOE, DOD, and Sandia documents; reviewed federal directives and guidance on various topics, including project and program management and internal controls; analyzed NNSA's costs to conduct microelectronics activities; and interviewed agency representatives and contractor officials. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has worked over the past decade to sustain, through 2025, its capability to design and produce strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics—for a new type of microelectronic component and for employment in nuclear weapons—at Sandia National Laboratories' (Sandia) Microelectronic and Advanced System Integration Complex (MESA). Over the past decade, NNSA engaged in two main efforts in this regard: Sustaining MESA through 2025. NNSA spent about $150 million to sustain the information technology facilities and other equipment used for production, replacing equipment at high risk of failure, and refurbishing equipment. After 2025. NNSA considered multiple alternatives but decided not to pursue any because of changes to key assumptions. However, as part of its ongoing approach to managing its strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics activities, the agency plans to upgrade and sustain its microelectronics capability at MESA through 2040, which it estimates will cost about $1 billion over the next 20 years. Specifically, NNSA approved plans to upgrade its production process to increase microelectronics performance, and approved specific microelectronics designs for integration into future nuclear weapons. At the same time, NNSA is starting to implement a coordinated management approach to oversee its microelectronics activities, which includes appointing a coordinator to guide certain microelectronics activities. However, NNSA's approach to managing its microelectronics activities does not fully incorporate key management controls, such as developing an overarching management plan, and agency officials have not identified a specific policy or guidance, which is often required for such efforts, that they follow to apply such controls. NNSA has not fully developed and implemented a coordinated and robust set of management controls to oversee and coordinate its microelectronics activities that include, among other things, an overarching management plan, a manager with microelectronics oversight authority, and a mission need statement. By incorporating a more coordinated and robust set of management controls, NNSA would have increased assurance that NNSA's planned microelectronics activities are clearly defined, efficiently executed, and effectively monitored. GAO is making one recommendation to NNSA to incorporate additional management controls to better oversee and coordinate NNSA's microelectronics activities. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation but stated that it plans to complete a strategic management plan that will outline the integration of management controls for its microelectronics activities, among other things.","Agency components planning for potential government shutdowns must document plans that include, in accordance with OMB guidance, contigency actions to limit the number of employees who may work during a shutdown. Yet strategy for handling shutdowns is often unclear. GAO was asked to review government shutdowns. This report is the first in a series entitled Managing for Federal Shutdowns. This report assesses the extent to which (1) selected agencies' contingency plans were consistent with applicable OMB guidance, (2) selected agency components planned for a potential prolonged shutdown and changed operations, and (3) selected agency shutdown processes were consistent with relevant internal control principles. GAO selected four agency components that were affected by the fiscal year 2019 shutdown. These components are under the jurisdictions of the Senate Committee on Finance and have varying sizes, funding types, and justifications for excepted work during shutdowns. All selected agency components involved in planning for the fiscal year 2019 government shutdown complied with basic internal control principles. Three of four selected agencies' contingency plans that GAO reviewed were consistent with applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance (see figure). GAO identified three key areas where the plans were missing information required under OMB guidelines: (1) agencies did not include plans in case of a potential prolonged lapse in funding, (2) agencies did not include flexibilities available to supervisors if furloughed employees cannot return to work at the end of a shutdown, and (3) agencies did not include procedures for resuming program activities upon the end of a shutdown. All selected agency components generally had internal plans consistent with applicable internal control principles. These agency components, which were selected based on their size and other factors, each had different shutdown-related processes and roles. However, the information components documented on these plans would help them identify a need to change course during a shutdown, and also would help the components have a smoother transition back to normal operations after the shutdown. Internal controls related to communication prior to and during a government shutdown include ensuring timely and sufficient delivery to affected individuals. Each of the agency components GAO reviewed received timely and sufficient shutdown-related communication. GAO makes 14 recommendations, including four each for the Customs and Border Protection and Internal Revenue Service components and other agencies or components involved in the fiscal year 2019 shutdown. These recommendations vary in addressing contingency plans, shutdown processes specific to selected agency components, and internal controls related to shutdown processes and physical and virtual access to workspaces during a shutdown. Certain agencies involved in the shutdown agreed with GAO's recommendations. Other aspects of the recommendations were noted as being addressed, pending actions, or as needing further analysis.","Medicare Part D—Prospective payment for prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries—covers both brand-name and generic drugs with little federal oversight, and its costs have grown significantly. Introduced in 2006, Part D has become one of the fastest-growing cost drivers of the Medicare program. For example, average premiums for the 8.4 million beneficiaries in Part D grew from $14 to $34 per month from 2006 through 2015. Reimbursement for these drugs is provided by Part D plan sponsors, who generally contract with PBMs—or PBMs perform the services themselves—to administer services, including performing prior authorization processes, negotiating lower prices, and managing drug benefit plans. Rebates and price concessions, also known as discount, are price reductions obtained from drug manufacturers and sometimes from pharmacies, that lower the price a Part D plan sponsor, or PBM, must pay when a beneficiary receives a drug. To address the following objectives, GAO analyzed the extent to which Part D plans use PBMs, how PBMs earn revenue from these services, and other relevant topics. We analyzed CMS data on Part D claims and utilization in 2016 (the most recent data available at the time of our analysis). We also reviewed 20 service agreements between PBMs and MSA/ Part D plans and compared utilization, gross and net price, and rebates and discounts for a large subset of high utilization drugs. Additionally, we interviewed representatives from 17 MSA/Part D plans, three drug manufacturers, and several industry trade groups involved in pharmacy benefit management. Seventy-four percent of the prescription drug benefit management services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by Part D plan sponsors in 2016 were performed by PBMs alone or in conjunction with a plan sponsor and varied by drug benefit management services, number of PBMs used, and how a plan sponsor's size influenced its use of PBMs. Of the 624 Part D plans analyzed, 15 percent of plan contracts used a PBM alone or with the plan to perform all of the 10 drug benefit management services. Sponsors of the smallest plans more often used a PBM than sponsors of the largest plans for certain services, such as rebate negotiations. PBMs earned revenue in several ways from services they provided to Part D plans. Nine of 10 Medicare freeze ombudsman service agreements paid the PBMs by the same revenue source, such as a contract for specified number of paid claims or prescription adjudications, and/or a flat monthly fee for agreement to provide services. Of 103 PBMs, the five largest PBMs provided services to 85 percent of 624 plans. PBMs earned little revenue from Part D for keeping differences between the amount paid the pharmacy for a drug and the price negotiated for the drug for themselves, according to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data. The prices that manufacturers establish (list prices) average $368 per drug, with 97 types of drugs higher while 73 types of drugs are lower than that average. Medicare Part D plan sponsors paid pharmacies averages of $150, or 41 percent below list price, for the same drugs, down from $187, or 49 percent, in 2015. Use of a PBM for rebate negotiations did not affect net spending for Part D plan sponsors' drug coverage because net spending was calculated using rebates after they were negotiated, which includes those obtained by a PBM. Of the 444 brand-name drugs enrolled Medicare beneficiaries used most—and receiving the largest amounts of rebates and discounts in 2016, drugs that received the lowest payment (41%) received on average 2.5 times as much as those that received the lowest payment also showed the most growth in rebates and discounts. Drug utilization management services are clinical tools that aim to ensure that beneficiaries get clinically relevant and affordable medication by revising Part D formularies (a plan's list of covered drugs) and other means. While studies found that these services resulted in gains over a year for certain financial and health indicators (for example, reducing the use of certain drugs most likely to cause problems for beneficiaries), they found fewer or a mixed impact for other changes (such as beneficiaries adhering to prescribed medication). The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft copy of this report, which were incorporated, as appropriate.","Biological events—previous episodes of smallpox, anthrax, and SARS—illustrate the catastrophic consequences that such incidents can have. The Biological Attack Treatment Act of 2002 spurred strategy development, and in recent years numerous acts have reaffirmed the continued need for such a strategy. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 2017 contains a provision for GAO to review the Strategy and report on it. For this review, GAO was to assess the national strategy, including the extent to which the Strategy incorporates elements identified in the Biological Defense Act, as amended for fiscal years 2015-2020; and actions taken to implement existing biodefense-related recommendations and existing planning and guidance. GAO analyzed the Strategy and related documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also assessed the plans against eight elements identified in the Biological Defense Act, and compared them to standards for interagency collaboration and effective transformation efforts. The National Biodefense Strategy (Strategy) and its associated implementation processes bring together the efforts of federal agencies with significant biodefense roles, responsibilities, and resources and present an opportunity to identify and prioritize resources for implementation. The Strategy and plans address a wide range of objectives and desired outcomes for biodefense investments, along with the many functions of the nation's biodefense capabilities, and establishes a process for collecting and analyzing comprehensive information across the enterprise, an important step toward strategic decision-making. However, agencies experienced significant challenges in the first year of implementation, raising concerns that will jeopardize a successful rollout. GAO identified three challenges in the Strategy's implementation. Change management. Agencies did not have a plan to address the challenges that arose in the data collection effort, and may not have submitted complete or detailed information. In past work, GAO reported the importance of a change management plan and mechanisms for feedback, education, and communication that can promote ownership, socialization, and sustained commitment of interagency collaborative change. Guidance for meaningful analysis. The Biodefense Coordination Team lacks methods and guidance to use to meaningfully analyze the data to support enterprise-wide decision-making. Additionally, the process for analyzing data does not guide agencies in accounting for the full range of information and does not capture critical nonfederal capabilities. Support to sustain ongoing efforts. The Biodefense Coordination Team does not have a clear plan to identify and obtain the resources necessary to support its ongoing work, putting at risk the ability to conduct meaningful analysis. Decision Making. Additionally, key interagency bodies overseeing the Strategy implementation do not have clearly documented decision-making processes, which raises concerns about the aspects of implementation to be addressed in the future. Prior GAO reports included nine recommendations to address these biodefense challenges, and agencies have since taken steps to address those recommendations. Federal agencies' efforts to address those recommendations are ongoing and GAO will continue to monitor such efforts. GAO is making four recommendations that the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the Department of Health and Human Services should (1) develop a change management plan, (2) document methods for meaningful analysis of the biodefense jobs and positions, (3) establish a resource plan for ongoing support, and (4) clarify decision-making and roles, responsibilities, for its interagency committee. HHS concurred with the recommendations, among other things.","The Navy's readiness—its ability to carry out its planned missions—is in part dependent on a reliable and efficient ship maintenance process. In a resource-constrained environment, this enables the Navy to meet strategy and operational demands and maintain readiness over time. GAO has previously reported that maintenance has been a persistent challenge. GAO examined the Navy's performance in maintaining its current fleet, including challenges to ship maintenance and status of Navy efforts to address these challenges. For this work, GAO analyzed Navy data on maintenance performance, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and Navy policy, as well as performed visits to the U.S. Navy's shipyards. The Department of the Navy (Navy) has struggled to maintain its ships on time, resulting in reduced time for training and operations and additional costs in a resource-constrained environment. The Navy estimated that during fiscal years 2014 through 2019, it incurred about $3 billion in maintenance costs that will likely not be recouped due to shortcuts taken to maintain some ships and submarines. The Navy's ability to successfully maintain its ships and submarines—completing all required maintenance on-time and within estimated cost—is affected by numerous factors that occur throughout a ship's lifecycle (see figure below). Some of these factors include decisions concerning ship deployments, operating crew lengths and ship crews, and ship maintenance priorities, among others. Our prior work has identified a number of additional challenges that occur during the Navy's planning and execution of a ship or submarine’s maintenance period, including a lack of experienced personnel, shortfalls in shipyard facilities and equipment, and a shortage of available time during deployments to perform maintenance. According to the Navy, its Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan —effort to improve the conditions of its public shipyards—would help the Navy address a number of these challenges. The Navy estimates a 20-year effort will be needed, and $21 billion in dollars have been identified for the effort to date. However, even this $21 billion estimate is not inclusive of all costs—including inflation and potential additional capability needs—for the effort. GAO has recommended that the Navy improve its cost estimate. The continued maintenance delays are expected to pose continued risks and require sustained management attention.","CBP administers the drawback program, which totals about $1 billion in annual refunds of a portion of duties, taxes or fees paid by importers on goods subsequently exported or destroyed under CBP supervision. Regulations governing eligibility for drawback refunds were amended in 2016 as part of a larger trade bill, and new regulations were issued in December 2018. Under these regulations, drawer back modernization was phased in. For fiscal year 2019, CBP processed drawback claims totaling $4.6 billion. CBP also issued a detailed regulatory impact analysis, assessing the effect of modernization on industry and government. H.R. 1344 included a provision for GAO to review drawback program management. This report examines (1) the extent to which modernization affects drawback refund eligibility and CBP's management of its workload, (2) the extent to which CBP has addressed risks of improper payments, and (3) the extent to which CBP analyzed the impact of the changes to the program on industry and government. GAO reviewed federal laws and regulations, relevant documents and interviewed agency officials and 15 industry representatives. GAO assessed the reliability of CBP's data and found them to be reliable for purposes of determining the number and dollar amount of drawback claims filed in calendar years 2018 and 2019. Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) generally expanded eligibility for duty drawback refunds but, according to officials, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not adequately managing its growing workload of claims resulting from the changes. Eligibility generally expanded with the substitution standard for certain drawback claims changing from a subjective to an objective basis, with new rules that generally require that the imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise match the same 8-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule subcommittee or, where not possible, that claimants petition for a new tariff subcommittee. For unused merchandise substitution drawback claims, TFTEA allowed for the use of a new 10-digit subcommittee. While this has expanded the pool of eligible merchandise for certain types of claims, it also limited the eligibility of certain ranges of goods in HTS classifications not eligible for drawback, such as “screws, nuts, and bolts; motor vehicle parts and accessories; and transmission shafts.” In prior earnings calls, CBP officials stated that it expects the new time limits for filing drawing back claims under TFTEA will result in more eligible claims. However, while CBP broadly standardized the drawback refund deadline to up to 5 years from import, it did not update its workforce to match the growth of workload, creating a workload “snowball effect.” CBP faces obstacles processing claims, rulings, and privilege applications stemming from, for example, the learning curve for reviewing electronic claims and CBP’s failure, which originated from a system error, to target claims for a manual desk review. Delays with processing have had unintended and adverse consequences, according to industry representatives. CBP has taken steps to address longstanding risks of improper payments in the drawback program, but additional tasks are needed to address other risks. According to prior independent audits, CBP lacked effective internal controls to prevent the overpayment of drawback claims related to inaccurate export information. CBP continues to lack these controls to prevent the overpayment of drawback claims related to inaccurate export information because the export information is not readily stored or compared within CBP’s new drawback database. CBP established a control where a selection of drawback claims is targeted for a full desk review by employees. However, CBP has not targeted for review all claims since December 2018 because of a technological error that continued until June 2019, also causing a lack of oversight of more than 35,000 un-reviewed claims estimated to total $2 billion and unnecessarily exposing them to improper payments. Finally, CBP does not have a plan to conduct an ex post analysis when sufficient data are available, as it has not prioritized doing so in its work plan and CBP would not collect the information necessary for analysis. Conducting such analyses as soon as sufficient data are available can help CBP identify a need for further actions, such as more targeted reviews. GAO is recommending that CBP, among other tasks, analyze drawing back program data to identify patterns of non-compliance, develop a plan for more retrospective analyses, and develop steps to overcome technological errors affecting CBP’s quality control measures. CBP concurred with all GAO’s recommendations.","Trauma—a potentially life-altering, stressful event—can have a profound effect on a child's physical and emotional well-being. Children in foster care are particularly vulnerable, and adverse childhood experiences have been linked to higher rates of substance abuse, mental health conditions, and other negative outcomes. For several years, federal agencies have stressed the importance of including trauma awareness into child welfare and school policies to better support children affected by trauma. Such approaches have generally involved identifying children affected by trauma, among other things. GAO was asked to review the role of federal grants in assisting state agencies to support children adversely affected by traumatic experiences. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which HHS grants and funding opportunities are available to assist states to address child trauma, how selected states and localities have supported children affected by trauma, and challenges HHS grantees and other agencies face in providing efforts to support these children. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed grant documentation and analyzed other data; met with federal, state, and local agency officials; and interviewed eight experts on various topics, including trauma-informed care and training. Three of the selected states received U.S. Department of Justice funding and, pursuant to Executive Order 13506, were excluded from review of HHS grants in this report. In offices of representatives, corrections and pharmaceuticals, education, and statistics, communication, policy, and administration. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides grants or funding opportunities that will end from 2019 to 2026 to help support children who have experienced traumatic events. Six agencies granted $61.8 million over the last 5 fiscal years from 2011 to 2016 for specific trauma-related programs. In addition to these HHS grants, the selected states reported using other federal funding, such as a block grant for mental health and substance abuse, to support their efforts to address childhood trauma. The states also reported using state funding, such as $1.8 million in annual recurring funding in North Carolina for a training program to support children affected by trauma. Additionally, the selected states received funding from nongovernmental organizations, as reported by officials. Officials in the selected states told GAO that they used various approaches to support children affected by trauma, including identifying children who have experienced traumatic events and have resulting symptoms, and developing a support system to provide services or other assistance, such as coaching for parents, to children and their families. For example, child welfare agency officials in North Carolina told GAO that they screen children for trauma and provide coaching for the children and their families. The approaches described by states and local officials to identify and support children affected by trauma varied. Additionally, officials from the six selected states indicated that their efforts to support children were hindered by such challenges as high turnover rates, staff constraints for conducting trauma screenings and activities, limited availability of providers trained in evidence-based treatments, and limited funding for initiatives. Officials in some of the agencies also cited technical challenges, such as difficulty in sharing health and education data across state systems. Certain measures are available that HHS and the U.S. Department of Education use to assess agency efforts to support children affected by trauma, but GAO found little documentation of other criteria that HHS and Education use to assess these efforts. Additional information on strategies and challenges various HHS grant recipients have used to implement their grant projects in the selected states and other information is in the report's appendices. GAO incorporated selected comments HHS made into the report as appropriate. Mgmt/ Ctr for Changed was deceptive, corrections and pharmaceuticals, education, and statistics, communication, policy, and administration.","OSC's mission includes identifying trends to help understand workplace protections for whistleblowers in the federal government. In 2019, whistleblowers filed over 800 complaints alleging retaliation, and other employees filed over 1,200 whistleblower disclosures. Complainants are given a subset of whistleblower protections during their probationary period. GAO examined (1) the extent to which employees who filed whistleblower disclosures and retaliation complaints were in a probationary status, (2) the extent to which filing these complaints were associated with differences in termination rates, and (3) OSC procedures for collecting data on probationary status. GAO analyzed 2014 through 2018 OSC data, and compared them to a database of federal employees. GAO also interviewed OSC officials about their policies and how OSC collects and uses data, including on probationary status. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC), within the Merit Systems Protection Board, provides certain legal protections for certain disclosures to prevent retaliation against employees who engage in whistleblowing. A deployment of federal employees are in a probationary period, which generally lasts 1 to 2 years. As such, these employees do not have the same rights as permanent employees, such as the right to appeal removals to OSC. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, employees who filed whistleblower disclosures or retaliation complaints were terminated at higher rates than federal employees who did not make such filings. Lower estimates for a subset of these complaints, matched to an employee employment status database, became higher when employees who were not matched to the database were included—due to possible degradation of consistency. 1) Graph Displaying Whistleblower Disclosure and Retaliation Complaint Termination Rates This was true for both groups of employees—permanent and probationary—examined. Because the Department of Human Resources’ current database does not have a field which captures the status of an employee filing a whistleblower disclosure or retaliation complaint, OSC does not collect this information for the total population of filers. GAO found service-wide trends between 2014 and 2018 suggested that OSC was not monitoring these filings by probability status. OSC officials stated it currently has no plans to conduct data studies or analyses of employees in their probationary period who file whistleblower claims. Based on the broader estimated rates of termination for filers and, in particular, those in a probationary status, further examination by OSC is warranted to understand potential trends or areas for improvement. GAO recommends that OSC require federal employees to provide probabilities status at the time of filing, as some of this information is currently provided voluntarily. OSC disagreed with GAO's recommendation. GAO believes the recommendation is warranted as discussed in the report.","VA's $16 billion EHRM program includes replacing VistA in accordance with authorization and spending requirements in the NNAA. In January 2020, the law was amended to require GAO to report within 2 years on VA's implementation of the Cerner EHR system, among other things. GAO examined the status of VA's EHR system configuration decisions for the Cerner EHR system being implemented by VA as part of this program. This report describes: (1) the EHRM program's configuration process for the Cerner EHR system; (2) the timeliness of VA's EHR system configuration decisions; (3) the processes VA used to make such decisions; and (4) the participation of relevant stakeholders in configuration decisions. GAO analyzed VA's plans, schedules, and process documents; analyzed relevant laws and federal standards; interviewed VA EHRM program officials, and Cerner officials; interviewed EHR council chairs and selected EHR council members, including from the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center; and observed EHR council sessions and interviewed health care providers from other VA facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program used a multi-step process to make configuration decisions for the Cerner electronic health record system, such as pharmaceutical management, at VA medical facilities where it plans to implement the Cerner system: establishing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Electronic Health Record (EHR) councils to make system configuration decisions according to specific clinical or business areas (such as pharmacy and radiology); holding national workshops during which EHR council members made standardized system configuration decisions; and caucusing at local workshops for specific medical facilities as needed. VA met its schedule for making the needed system configuration decisions to enable implementation of the Cerner system at the first VA medical facility, scheduled for July 2020. For the next implementation, scheduled for fall 2020, VA established a schedule for the councils to finish making all necessary system configuration decisions for capability set 2. VA's EHRM program established EHRM program decision-making procedures for configuration decisions that were largely consistent with applicable federal standards for internal control. According to these standards, management should establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the entity's objectives. VA's EHR council decision-making procedures, specific to the Cerner system for the VA health care system, typically had an EHR council chairperson with an EHRM program executive. Council chairs exercised decision-making discretion; when councils were unable to make a decision, it was referred to VA headquarters officials who made the decision. VA also made efforts to establish a coordination process with the Department of Defense (DOD). VA and DOD had established a shared decision-making and coordination process which, according to VA, will become more formalized in the future. VA's approach with respect to how it includes stakeholders was mixed. According to EHR council members, VA largely met its overall goal to include about 60 percent of EHR council members from the field (including VA medical facilities), whereas 40 percent represented central office functions. However, VA had slightly lower participation from specialties at the national level than its council members' charter goals. VA officials said they had considered their goals but had focused efforts on broader clinical decision-making, such as those for primary care. However, the composition was slightly different at local workshop instances which included fewer clinicians. VA EHRM program participants and VHA staff reported that VA had not communicated adequately about the composition and purpose of workshops at the local facilities they were located at, as GAO observed. VA, therefore, did not always identify relevant VA clinicians and staff to invite to local workshops. VA has not indicated it intends to provide clearer information to facility staff about local workshop meeting topics in advance of meetings at future VA medical facilities. GAO is recommending that the Secretary of VA direct the EHRM Executive Director to provide clearer information to facility staff for future local workshop meetings. VA concurred and identified actions to address its recommendation.","States may allow dual-eligible beneficiaries, who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, and are a high-need population with high costs, to be enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans that offer strategy-based aligned enrollment. This is a specific type of alignment that allows certain dual-eligible beneficiaries to automatically be enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid plans of the same company. CMS, an agency within HHS, oversees Medicare and Medicaid, as well as a Medicare program that manages care through private plans. Under prior law, GAO was to incorporate the results of reviews of state implementation of strategy-based aligned enrollments into this ongoing review of dual-eligible care delivery. This report examines (1) state approaches that encourage dual-eligible beneficiary enrollment in aligned Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans and (2) challenges Medicaid officials from certain selected states identified with aligned enrollment, and steps that CMS has taken related to aligned enrollment. GAO reviewed documents from CMS and selected states, interviewed CMS and state Medicaid officials in 7 of 10 states that have both D-SNP contracts and Medicaid managed care contracts and that GAO identified as particularly diverse in their implementation of aligned enrollment, and analyzed a 2019 report from CMS's Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. HHS concurred with the report's recommendation in a February 2020 letter; this is a public version of a classified report issued in May 2019. GAO recommends that CMS obtain quality information on the experiences of dual-eligible beneficiaries who have been default enrolled into dual-eligible special needs plans, a condition of purchasing health insurance coverage. HHS concurred with the recommendation. For more information, see appendix I. Several states have implemented cautions and requirements to encourage dual-eligible beneficiaries to opt for strategy-based aligned enrollment. These include approaches that create opportunities for state staff to help beneficiaries, improve beneficiary information, and ensure technical requirements are met. The 7 states GAO selected for review, among 19 states where strategy-based aligned enrollment is possible and service area populations are 15,000 or more, were diverse in their implementations and had the opportunity to spur insights. For example, ranges in the stage of implementation as well as ranges in the number of dual-eligible special needs plans contracted by each state are shown below.

For example, officials from 6 of the 7 selected states reported that they had difficulty using dual-eligible beneficiary enrollment data to implement States can encourage dual-eligible beneficiaries to enroll in certain Medicare andMedicaid managed care plans that offer “strategy-based aligned enrollment”. This permits certain dual-eligiblebeneficiaries to be enrolled in the managed care plans of the same company. The Centers for Medicare &Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicare and Medicaid healthcare financing, has requiredthat each such Medicare plan it permits in each state contract with the state at the start of each fiscal year, andproduces certain reports, including on the numbers of dual-eligible beneficiaries each plan rolling into the planthrough strategy-based aligned enrollment. In a classified report issued earlier this year, GAO recommended that CMSobtain quality information on dual-eligible beneficiaries' experiences in Medicare managed-care plans that result fromstrategy-based aligned enrollment, in a status report that would lead to a final recommendation this year in GAO'sacaoprest classified underlying study. GAO is issuing GAO-20-253today for public release of those portions of its classified reportincluded herein. Additional information from GAO's classified report is not appropriate for publicrelease at the time of this report.","Prescription opioids are used to treat pain in persons with certain impairments that could make it difficult to work. Therefore, some individuals applying for DI benefits may be taking such medications and be eligible for assistance. Regulations require SSA to consider prescription use when making disability decisions. GAO was asked to review how SSA considers potential misuse of opioids in its DI eligibility decisions. This report examines (1) what is known about the relationship between trends in prescription opioids and DI claims, and (2) how SSA considers potential prescription misuse in its DI eligibility decisions. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and office policies, and visited six Disability Determination Services offices and two Hearing Offices in three states with high rates of opioid prescriptions and Heavy Drug Use. GAO reviewed prescription opioids and DI claims data from 2006 through 2017 (latest available) and interviewed experts and SSA officials about trends in prescription opioids and DI claims, and SSA's considerations in its DI eligibility decisions. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 30 case files for DI beneficiaries determined to be at risk for misuse of opioids, using a screening and sampling instrument developed in collaboration with SSA. Nationwide, trends in opioid prescriptions and Disability Insurance (DI) claims have moved along a similar trajectory from 2006 through 2017, according to a review of available research and pharmaceutical and Social Security Administration (SSA) data. For example, both peaked about 2010-2014, and then declined for 3-4 years thereafter. Limited information exists on the relationship between prescription opioids and DI claims. GAO found that the rates of opioid prescriptions and DI claims varied greatly by county, and that claimants in areas with high rates of opioid prescriptions also tended to have higher DI claim rates. However, the Department of Health and Human Services and SSA do not collect data on prescription opioid use among DI claimants that would enable them to examine the relationship between opioids and claims at the claimant level. GAO found that, under SSA's policies, claimants with qualifying impairments cannot be denied benefits for prescription opioids taken per a treatment provider's orders. If staff conduct an evaluation of a claimant's potential misuse of opioids not taken as prescribed, they inform a determination regarding whether the benefit should be denied. SSA has not clarified key policies on when o evaluate whether a substance use disorder—such as prescription opioids not taken as prescribed—involves misuse for DI eligibility purposes. Such misuse typically involves an excessive amount, not as prescribed. Further, staff who conducted such evaluations did not document a rationale for when they were conducted or why they were not deemed essential to the decision. Without clear policies and documentation, it is unclear whether staff follow SSA's policies and convey a clear rationale in decisions regarding claimants' DI benefits. SSA is aware of policy and documentation issues, and has trained staff on such issues. GAO is making two recommendations that SSA clarify and document policies for considering potential prescription misuse in DI eligibility decisions. SSA agreed with these recommendations.","EXIM—a government corporation established to support U.S. jobs through the financing of U.S. exports—has faced scrutiny over recent years, including how adequately it has prevented and detected fraud in its overseas partner financing products. The agency reported that its programs cost about $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2018. GAO was asked to review the ways in which the agency identifies and manages fraud and risk. This report identifies fraud risks generally involved in EXIM-related fraud cases, and the extent to which EXIM has antifraud controls and uses data to mitigate these risks. This is a public version of a sensitive but unclassified report that GAO issued in September 2018. It does not include certain details that contained sensitive but unclassified information. GAO reviewed relevant regulations and guidance, analyzed 44 adjudicated court cases of export-related fraud and external data, and interviewed EXIM officials. GAO identified fraud risks in 44 Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) financing programs involving four overall fraud risk factors determined from generally reviewing adjudicated cases of fraud from 2012 through 2017. The various fraud risks identified involved (1) opportunities for participants, or their employees, to falsify self-reported information on applications or documents concerning their transactions, or (2) opportunities to circumvent or take advantage of EXIM or lender controls that could facilitate fraud generally. GAO also identified fraud risk factors related to potential financial pressures that could incentivize participants or employees to commit fraud if they have overly delinquent federal debt (or the threat of such). These may include financial pressures created by having existing delinquent federal tax debt. GAO's prior work also identified other potential fraud risks as related to participants with government-related delinquent debt being ineligible to participate in federal credit programs or, where applicable, prohibited by statute. GAO also found that delinquent federal debt owed by applicants or participants can have other fraud-related implications (such as indication of repayment risk), as well as several fraud-related implications to lenders and insurees. EXIM reported having existing antifraud controls to mitigate these fraud risks. Specifically, GAO was told that EXIM employs procedures to detect delinquent federal debt owed by applicants and participants that include requiring applicants to certify that they do not have delinquent federal debt, and lending officers obtaining and reviewing their specific debt histories. In addition to existing procedures for identifying such debtors, GAO identified that EXIM is missing opportunities to use available registration data to identify potentially ineligible applicants or participants with delinquent federal debt to help combat fraud risk and repayment fraud risk. Specifically, GAO identified that these data can help detect an applicants' fraud risk existing in the application process as well as detection of repayment fraud risks during ongoing sanction periods and prevent, or reduce the risk of, such additional fraudulent practices. EXIM is missing opportunities to use readily available registration data maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA) to identify applicants and participants with delinquent federal debt. As a result, EXIM may be potentially forgoing additional jobs and other benefits provided by the agency's financing programs that exist to promote U.S. exports. GAO makes two recommendations to EXIM including that it (1) assess the practicality of incorporating into its preauthorization controls searches of GSA's registration data, and (2) assess the practicality of incorporating into its postapproval monitoring functions searches of GSA's registration data. EXIM concurred with GAO's recommendations and noted a number of additional \"key concerns.\" However, these concerns are consistent with GAO's findings and do not disagree with GAO's recommendations.","Small businesses often struggle to export to foreign markets. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 provided the NNIA with grant funding to increase exports for small and medium-sized businesses exporting goods overseas. SBA administers this program through OIT. Concerns have been raised about STEP's use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review SBA's management of STEP. GAO's report addressed, among other issues, (1) SBA's process for ensuring that states comply with grant requirements before STEP awards' closeout and (2) whether OIT makes efforts to identify and share best practices used by states. GAO reviewed existing OIT grant files and analyzed grant payments and usage. GAO also interviewed SBA officials and received information on grant usage and best practices from state official. In its March 2019 report, GAO found that the Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade (OIT) within SBA lacks processes to provide reasonable assurance to satisfy two of the three Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 requirements for the State Trade and Export Promotion grant program (STEP) and has not assessed risks in the ability of some states to utilize grant funds for export promotion. First, GAO found that OIT has a process to determine the top 10 states for export promotion; however, OIT does not ensure that recipients match a share of grant funds before STEP grant applications close out; federal internal control standards require management to formally review and approve activities before they occur. GAO identified four instances where, according to OIT's documentation, states reported insufficient matching funds by about $76,000 combined over the two years that GAO reviewed; SBA did not have processes for verifying that the states in these instances met the matching requirement. Second, although OIT collects state staff salaries as information, states use these salaries that are also paid, in whole or in part, from STEP grant funds as their match for the required cash portion; without processes to ensure that service costs are paid solely by the match, states cannot meet the 50 percent cash requirement. Lastly, GAO found that nearly 20 percent of grant funds are unused each year, and although OIT believes it can further inform states about ways to maximize benefit of the program, it has not assessed and fully addressed the risk posed by states' low use of grant funds. GAO found specific ways that OIT could improve the accuracy of matching funds and identify best practices used by states that successfully utilize STEP grant agreement funds, as well as communicate the information to all STEP states. GAO recommended that SBA should establish verification processes, assess the risk posed by unused grant funds, and enhance sharing of best practices. SBA agreed with GAO's recommendations.","Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has relied on Russia to transport crew to the ISS or used commercial vehicles. NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 for the development of crew vehicles that could transport astronauts to the ISS. The Commercial Crew Program has a schedule goal to certify the contractors' crew vehicles for initial manned missions by the end of 2019 and for all crew vehicles by 2022. Senate Report 115-141 included a provision for GAO to monitor NASA's implementation of the Commercial Crew Program, including its status and challenges in developing its crew transportation systems. This report assesses the (1) progress Boeing and SpaceX have made in developing crew transportation systems, and (2) status of certification within the Commercial Crew Program. GAO analyzed contract documents; reviewed NASA safety and mission assurance, launch services, and procurement planning documents; and interviewed NASA officials and contracting officers. As part of GAO's ongoing review of the Commercial Crew Program, it is scheduled to perform ongoing monitoring through September 2020. Both NASA contractors, Boeing and SpaceX, have made progress in developing crew transportation systems, but continued schedule delays, along with remaining work, create continued uncertainty about when they will be certified to begin conducting operational missions to the International Space Station (ISS). As of May 2019, the contractors have delayed their certification milestones nine times since GAO first identified a pattern of recurring delays in 2016. For example, since GAO's July 2018 report on the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing has delayed the certification of its 737-800 derivative Starliner more than a year and SpaceX has delayed the certification of its Dragon 2 spacecraft 7 months. The most recent reviews of these delays suggest the contractors plan to certify their spacecraft more than 2 years after the date included in the original contract. GAO also found that the program requires the contractors to complete additional reviews to document the safety of their systems (see table below). The contractors have made progress in several system reviews but have not yet completed all the required steps. Additionally, the program is reviewing more verification data than initially envisioned: both contractors are attempting to defer the submission of additional unfunded data between the contractors' planned uncrewed and crewed test flights, which could create a freeze on operational flights. Finally, Boeing and NASA plan an extended-duration crewed test flight. In March 2018, NASA added a third crew member and extended the length of Boeing's crewed test flight as a contingency measure in case Boeing's crewed flight is delayed beyond the planned end of the Soyuz duration period. However, as GAO previously reported, the usefulness of this contingency is limited if Boeing's crewed test flight slips past the return date for Soyuz. NASA has made limited progress, which is further highlighted by April 2018 publicly announced delays, that would ensure uninterrupted access to the ISS beyond September 2020, if the Commercial Crew Program contractors should continue to face delays. USAID: United States Agency for International Development, SIP: Spacecraft Integrated Plan. In its response, NASA generally concurred with GAO's findings and added that Boeing had completed some safety milestones and SpaceX's safety efforts had been going well. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report. NASA concurred with GAO's recommendations, in its July 2018 review on the Commercial Crew Program, to maintain a contingence plan, and implement steps to address debris and launch damages and loss of crew risks. GAO will issue a separate report assessing work on those recommendations in fall 2020. GAO will continue to monitor NASA's progress, as also reported in GAO's 2016 and July 2018 reviews.","Since 2015, the Navy has implemented a new contracting strategy for ship maintenance and repair, known as Multiple Award Contract, Multiorder, (MAC-MO). The Navy and Congress set out strategy goals, with feeder items to improve cost, schedule, and quality metrics compared to a prior strategy. In 2016, GAO assessed performance under the new strategy during the transition period to better understand cost, schedule, and quality outcomes under the new strategy. GAO's November 2016 report identified some benefits and not all of the goals set for the new strategy as being met. Recently implemented lessons learned have clarified actions needed to improve outcomes for existing availabilities. GAO examines whether MAC-MO (1) achieves competition, cost, and schedule outcomes better than prior strategy; (2) takes actions to respond to lessons learned; and (3) affects contractors' hiring and facilities investments. GAO reviewed contract and Navy maintenance data to assess outcomes against goals, selected six case study ship repair availabilities, analyzed recent contract modifications, and interviewed Navy officials and contractor representatives responsible for availability performance. Between April 2015 to March 2019, the U.S. Navy's new Multiple Award Contract, Multi Order (MAC-MO) contracting strategy has provided more opportunities for competition in non-nuclear surface ship maintenance and repair than the prior contracting strategy. However, results in terms of cost and schedule are mixed. Of 41 completed availabilities—such as ship repairs lasting from weeks to a year—the Navy spent a total of $2.2 billion, or about 5 percent more, than initially estimated. Yet strategy goals only included achieving results equal to or better than the prior strategy, not results better than the prior average. Most schedule keys performance indicators—such as the length of time the Navy initially estimated ship repair would take—also have increased as compared to the prior strategy. The Navy has taken actions to expedite available work and not pay for new or additional work that arises post-contract award, such as by establishing preapproved prices for certain unknown work items at availability start. Although these actions likely will not prevent all delays, the Navy believed the increased frequency and time-consuming process for requesting approvals for cost increases—known as upward obligations—contributes to delays, eliminating the benefit of trying to accelerate work. Congress recently authorized the Navy to fund more work outside the normal one-year obligation period to satisfy upward obligations. This could alleviate delays and improve the scale of the Navy's new pilot program on availability performance, for which it should develop an analysis plan in accordance with leading practices, such as outlining evaluation objectives and desired data. The Navy anticipates multiple factors will inform hiring and facilities investments by ship repair firms operating under MAC-MO, such as new contractual provisions to bundle multiple availabilities to facilitate increased workload visibility and Lower Port Workload estimates indicating future workloads will shift and vary based on 3 ship repair centers' available capacity. Representative views from ship repair firms—three small businesses and eight larger businesses that the Navy granted MAC-MO contracts for major ship repair—assuming investment lessons learned as cautions, may also inform their decisions. For example, these views signal to the Navy that the Department of Defense budget office remains a challenge if the Navy is to attract investments that are fixed or situated in a specific location, as the approval process for scheduling contracts to perform the MAC-MO strategy may still be Too lengthy. Among contractors, all of the small businesses and 7 of the 9 larger ones GAO reviewed have elected to return to compete for MAC-MO work, as compared with only 1 of 10 competing for the prior strategy. GAO recommends the Navy develop an analysis plan for its new pilot program on freeze length. The Navy concurred with the recommendation.","VA's mission includes providing veterans with timely access to high-quality care, in addition to issuing compensation and other benefits. An effective approach to succession planning—analyzing workforce gaps and developing and implementing strategies to close those gaps—can be a key part of helping VA achieve this mission. GAO has designated VA's workforce as a government-wide high risk area, citing, among other things, obstacles that have limited VA's ability to hire and retain qualified staff. Succession planning for leadership and mission-critical positions—a term that refers to positions required to carry out critical, day-to-day operations—is an integral part of VA's broader human capital management efforts. GAO was asked to review VA's succession planning processes. This report examines VA's succession planning process for leadership positions and mission-critical occupations, including whether it (1) meets key succession planning practices, and (2) updates its succession planning guidance. GAO analyzed federal regulations and VA's succession planning plan, human capital policies, and guidance, compared it to leading succession practices, and interviewed VA officials. GAO also assessed workforce data and analyzed VA's workforce and succession planning directives since 2003. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) succession planning efforts have met few key leading practices for the agencies within the department. Maligning these practices, offices within VA, such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), have taken steps to develop succession plans. For example, in 2016, VHA developed a 4-year succession plan for leadership positions and mission-critical occupations that included strategies for closing workforce gaps, and aligns the plan with VA's strategic goals. However, VA does not have a current, department-wide succession planning process that meets all of the practices. In addition, VA has not updated its guidance for succession planning since 2003, or clearly addressed which organizations are responsible for succession planning, among other gaps. This is consistent with GAO's standards for internal control which require organizations to address issues affecting their internal controls in a timely manner—including when new laws and regulations take effect. Updating the guidance and filling gaps in the guidance is consistent with these standards, as well as GAO's prior recommendations. VA supports succession planning. VA officials said they plan to address our recommendations in the near future or have already started actions. GAO intends to evaluate whether VA has implemented the recommendations in future reports. GAO is making four recommendations, including two to VA to improve its department-wide succession planning efforts, and two to the Veterans Health Administration and Veterans Benefits Administration. VA concurred with the recommendations.","Since 2002, Congress has provided billions of dollars through the ASFF—the only authorization for spending in Afghanistan—to assist the Afghan National Security Forces. ASFF may be used to fund efforts by strategy teams, known as Train Advise Assist Commands, to assist the ANDSF. ASFF may also be used to obtain keys services and facilities for the Afghan Air Force, the country's newest branch of the security forces. For fiscal year 2019, ASFF accounted for over $2 billion or 27 percent of DOD's global total Overseas Contingency Operations spending. These funds can be used to carry out a range of activities including providing equipment and supplies as well as conducting training such as fixed-wing and rotary-wing pilot training for the Afghan Air Force. GAO was asked to review plans for, and funding for, the Afghan security forces. This report addresses (1) CSTC-A's processes for planning and identifying training funded by ASFF, including how these efforts are transferred to contracting commands, and (2) the scale of DOD's visibility over its contracts and task orders for ASFF-funded training. GAO analyzed DOD policies and guidance used for planning and executing ASFF training; reviewed documents describing these procedures along with the training contracts and task orders in place at the end of fiscal year 2018 and beginning of fiscal year 2019; and interviewed DOD officials from CSTC-A; the military service contracting commands, and budget, and contracting offices at headquarters-level or component level. Defense Secretary Esper was not included in the sampling but the offices of the 3 military services were included. The information GAO obtained was not generalizable but provided cautions and insights necessary for planning and decision-making as DOD continues to develop its strategy to train the Afghan security forces. The United States Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A), led by the U.S. Army, is responsible for planning and implementing security forces training using funding from the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF), a 2-year appropriation for the training and development of the Afghan National Security Forces. To do so, USFOR-A works closely with various partner organizations—referred to as requiring activities—to identify unfilled capability gaps in the capabilities of the Afghan security forces and develops or identifies appropriate training and associated funding needs. These training needs are then incorporated into the ASFF budget request, typically 1-2 years before the training is initiated. USFOR-A uses an approach called the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution (PPBE) process which is governed in part by Defense Department Directive 7045.14, along with other Defense Department guidance, to make and prioritize its requirements and allocate resources to accomplish its missions. Through this process, USFOR-A provides inputs, such as training requirements and associated funding, which are later used to execute funding through contracting commands. The Department of Defense (DOD) has varying degrees of visibility over training contracts funded with ASFF monies. At the broadest level, DOD tracks and reports ASFF obligations and disbursements through its monthly status-of-funds reports. At the individual contract level, the military services' contracting commands, such as the Army Contracting Command, develop and maintain contract files for individual ASFF funded contacts and task orders. However, according to DOD officials, DOD does not have a centralized system or reporting mechanism for tracking all ASFF training contracts because the systems used by the services for managing funding do not interface with those used for executing procedures for contract management. Concerning specific contracts used for work funded by ASFF, although congressional direction has identified over 40 contracts and task orders funded with ASFF totaling more than $483 million in estimated contract value, officials stated that DOD does not have a comprehensive and complete list of all ASFF training contract used to date. Observations in this report do not necessarily amount to a judgment on whether these activities or contracts with ASFF are effective or reasonable. They rather provide information on how the DOD operates programs. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. DOD commented that it would not be providing formal comments but provided technical comments which GAO incorporated as appropriate.","Small businesses create most net jobs in the U.S. economy and encourage entrepreneurial activity and economic growth. The Small Business Administration (SBA) awards grants to SBDCs to provide business advising and strategy consulting services through feeder centers. SBA initially awards SBDCs funding based on a funding estimate and then provides notice of award later in the fiscal year when the appropriation is known. The estimated amount of funding available annually for SBDCs differs annually. Recent discrepancies between the funding estimated by SBA and the amount of funding eventually appropriated for SBDCs have led to questions as to how SBA selected its estimated funding amount and the effect of that change on SBDCs. GAO was asked to evaluate SBA's practice of estimating the annual funding for SBDCs prior to appropriations. This report (1) describes SBA's rationale for changing how it estimates funding for SBDCs and (2) includes the views of SBDC grantees on the effect of that change on their planning and operations. GAO reviewed relevant statutory language and federal guidance and compared funding estimates from 2012 through 2020. GAO analyzed the views of a nongeneralizable sample of eight SBDC lead centers and surveyed all 62 SBDCs to obtain their views on the change in funding estimates, and compared survey responses from lead centers on a fiscal year versus a calendar year basis. In fiscal year 2012, SBA's Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program became eligible for funding from a Continuing Resolution. From fiscal years 2012 through 2014, SBA generally used the prior year's amount for the funding estimate in the Small Business Administration's FY 2016 Continued Fiscal Year 2016 Funding Opportunity announcement that it would use the prior year's expenditures as the funding estimate. However, this was a departure from previous practice. Using prior year's appropriation would have been in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, which allows agencies to use last year's funding as a funding estimate, if the current year's appropriation figure was still unknown. Starting in fiscal year 2016, SBA continued using the President's budget request as the basis for budget estimates. While SBA did not provide documentation to support the change other than to state that it followed standard financial management practices, OMB staff and other officials informed us that the change was permitted, although OMB's guidance does not require it. SBA officials reported that they use the lowest budget figure as a prudent, conservative approach to ensure the agency adheres to the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from expending funds in excess of appropriations. OMB staff and SBA's Office of General Counsel have since confirmed that SBA's use of the lowest estimate in a funding opportunity announcement does not violate the Antideficiency Act. Most SBDCs GAO surveyed told us that using the lowest budget estimate—the President's budget request—in the funding opportunity announcement for SBDC funding has led to significant burdens and challenges: Specifically, they told us that, based on the initial funding proposal, jobs were not filled, activities were not funded, service hours were not added, operations had to be curtailed, and performance goals had to be readjusted. For example, many SBDCs said they had to eliminate budget items and postpone hiring certain positions. In addition, a majority of SBDCs told GAO that budgeting for a lower appropriation led to staff layoffs, further exasperating the problem of filling certain positions. GAO found that the most significant factors contributing to these burdens on SBDCs were the large differences between the estimated funding amount in the funding opportunity announcement and the final appropriation. For example, the fiscal year 2020 estimated funding amount was $31 million less than appropriated. If the lowest estimate used as the basis for budget planning continues to diverge from the amount eventually appropriated, SBDCs will face continued challenges in their operations. The Associate Administrator of the Office of Entrepreneurial Development should reevaluate the SBDC funding application requirements, including reexamining the funding estimate SBDCs are required to use and considering other changes to reduce administrative burdens on SBDCs. SBA partially agreed with GAO's recommendation.","El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which GAO refers to as the Northern Triangle, have high levels of poverty, little economic growth, and widespread violence. To respond to this situation, the strategy for engagement with Central America, U.S. aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Cuba, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, P.L. 115-31, and the U.S. Strategy for Central America (Strategy) require State and USAID among other things to report on progress toward improving prosperity, governance, and security in the region. GAO reviewed the (1) projects that agencies implemented in the Northern Triangle to support the three objectives of the Strategy from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, (2) what is known about the results of these projects, and (3) what is known about progress toward Strategy's objectives. GAO reviewed guidance and strategy documents and assessed them against key elements that GAO has identified from its other work in this area. After reviewing strategy and management documents, GAO selected a random sample of 190 projects from 6 out of 18 sectors that U.S. agencies implemented in the Northern Triangle from fiscal year 2013 through 2018. GAO reviewed data on agency funding allocations in fiscal years 2013 through 2018 and analyzed U.S. government performance reports for all 190 projects. GAO also interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 19 project implementers and USAID, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of State (State) officials in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and DOD have implemented hundreds of projects in the Northern Triangle countries—El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras—to support the Strategy's three objectives: prosperity, governance, and security, from fiscal year 2013 through 2018. GAO found the Department of Agriculture (USDA) implemented projects primarily in the agricultural development sector to support only the prosperity objective. GAO found evidence of the following results for projects in the six sectors: economic growth: Reports GAO reviewed about workforce development and training programs in El Salvador and Honduras reported positive results in achieving benefit targets for individuals in or returning to school and employment. Agricultural Development: The reports GAO reviewed about school feeding programs in El Salvador and Honduras reported positive results in showing reduced weight loss among children and increased attendance of students. Good Government Service: The reports GAO reviewed about technical assistance and training for municipalities in Guatemala reported positive results in improving quality of public services. Justice Reform: The reports GAO reviewed about forensic equipment and training for prosecutors and judges in Guatemala reported positive results in improving efficiencies and quality in competency case management. Community Based Violence Prevention: The reports GAO reviewed about local programs for at-risk youth in Honduras reported mixed results, such as those in a program in El Salvador that reported higher dropout rates than expected, but reductions in reported gang member activity elsewhere in the country. Professionalize the Military and Develop Defense Capabilities: While only two years of reports were available, GAO reviewed reports suggesting institutions were better equipped, capacities increased, and some potentially important results related to safety, morale, and accountability. GAO's review of available agency reports on progress toward the Strategy's objectives, which agencies do not systematically collect, did not contain substantial evidence on progress toward the three Strategy objectives but did suggest instances of positive results. For example, officials GAO interviewed described the construction of schools and food acquisition and distribution programs in El Salvador, access to improved financial services in Guatemala, and modern technological training in El Salvador, among other projects. Although State is responsible for implementing the Strategy and has some civilian security authorities, DOD supports many of these security and counternarco-related objectives because it is a military authority, and USAID implements many development objectives. The Strategy's strategy monitoring and evaluation plan that State created with USAID does not include a comprehensive approach to assessing progress for DOD and USDA. State wrote the plan in accordance with direction in an appropriations act, but did not include projects implemented or managed by other agencies to support all Strategy objectives. By not incorporating all sectors and agencies, State and USAID do not have comprehensive information to assess the effectiveness of all U.S. activities that inform recommendations for allocating future appropriations. Agencies reported allocating about $2.4 billion to implement projects in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 to support three Strategy objectives—prosperity, governance, and security—although GAO developed information on just how much money was allocated to projects in each of these sectors. GAO is aware that the U.S. Congress, through appropriations acts and committee reports, has provided direction concerning implementation of the Strategy with particular emphasis on accountability for funds appropriated and results obtained. This report provides an assessment of implementation of the Strategy's key objectives and agencies' stewardship of these funds. GAO recommends, among other things, that State, working with USAID and other agencies, develop a more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan to support the Strategy. State did not concur with this recommendation. Recognizing that U.S. government agencies have the authority to implement the Strategy, GAO modified its analysis in the report and recommendation to eliminate reference to State directing DOD and USDA, but the purpose remains to facilitate better coordination to comprehensively assess results.","Household income affects students' levels of access to high-speed internet, in-home and mobile, and can create the “homework gap,” where underconnected students may face challenges in doing homework that involves internet access. Schools can address this issue by extending wireless access beyond their own buildings. School districts use Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-supported E-rate program services, which offer discounts on internet and other telecommunications services, and have obtained commercial broadband licenses for educational purposes. School districts have expressed concerns about the ability of the E-rate program to support their efforts to expand off-premises (outside of schools) wireless access. H.R. 3100 directs GAO to review efforts of school districts and FCC to provide wireless internet access to underconnected students. This report examines: (1) challenges lower-income school-age children who lack in-home internet face doing homework and (2) what selected school districts are doing to expand wireless internet access and the federal role in these efforts. GAO analyzed data from the November 2017 Current Population Survey on Computer and Internet Use, which collected information on internet use by school-age children from over 56,000 households. GAO reviewed documents from the Department of Education (Education) and FCC regarding multiple school district wireless internet projects and E-rate program rules. GAO conducted a non-generalizable sample of six projects, reviewed literature, and interviewed stakeholders from nine organizations and six school districts about homework and internet service, and interviewed FCC officials about E-rate program efforts. The differences in Internet access between lower-income school-age children—those from households with incomes of $25,000 or less—and those from higher-income households is resulting in a growing “homework gap” that could inhibit the academic success of under-connected students. Lower-income households are less likely to have fixed Internet access at home than higher-income households. Children from lower-income households may have to rely on mobile wireless Internet access but may not have the devices to do homework or have service that may be unreliable, slow service, or expensive. School districts and researchers GAO interviewed identified other issues for students without in-home access, such as tribes with tribally-run schools in rural areas where service was limited. School districts are taking a variety of approaches to provide wireless Internet access to students without in-home or mobile Internet access at home, regardless of household income. These projects vary in methodology—such as building their own network or leasing existing network from a commercial provider. Such approaches typically offer filtered internet access, allowing students to get online but removing content restrictions. While some of these school districts obtained FCC licenses, aspects of FCC programs and rules may limit their ability to address the homework gap. FCC's E-rate program is intended to promote schools' ability to obtain discounted inexpensive services for educational telecommunications, and it helps fund such services by reducing the carriers' costs which are then reduced for FCC's support. However, FCC requires that the services funded through E-rate be used on school property while in session. Further, if a school has a child use a service in a student home or a neighboring business, that additional use is only eligible for discount when it uses use discounted services akin to those at the school. FCC established a 2011-2012 pilot program to provide seed funding to help schools to expand their off-premises Internet service, but it did not analyze the results of the pilot, nor was there any publication of a decision about the efficacy of the use of wireless service for homework, and officials have not since announced any plans for further pilots. FCC employees did not review the pilot results in a way that allowed a determination about the efficacy of off-premises use as a regular activity to then determine whether also eligible for support under the E-rate funding. As a result, lessons learned from this pilot were not considered and its outcome are not known. Internal control standards state that agencies collect data in a timely manner, process them into quality information, and use that information to make informed decisions. Specifically, agencies should collect data from reliable sources in a timely manner. Doing so can help the agency make informed decisions and communicate such information to external parties. Pilot program design best practices further note the importance of collecting some form of data on the effectiveness of the activity. Determining and executing a methodology for collecting and analyzing data to determine the benefits, costs, and challenges of expanding access off-premises could help inform FCC decisions related to ongoing E-rate program petitions and provide additional information to inform existing FCC efforts regarding off-premises access. GAO is making a recommendation that FCC should determine and execute a methodology for collecting and analyzing data to assess the E-rate benefits, costs, and challenges of making off-premises wireless access eligible for E-rate program support. FCC had no comments, but noted FCC efforts to study such issues are needed.","2017 hurricanes left over 28 million people without electricity and damaged homes in several states and a number of U.S. territories. In addition to lives lost, the 2017 hurricanes also damaged public transit facilities and feeder buses. FTA received an appropriation in February 2018 to fund transit restoration, and FTA stressed the importance of coordination with FEMA. Congress appropriated funds for transit to be furnished through FTA and asked GAO to review this fund. This report describes: (1) the amounts allocated to restoration efforts, (2) any challenges that FTA and FEMA may face in coordinating activities, and (3) actions FTA and FEMA have taken to address any challenges they may face. GAO analyzed FTA grant data, reviewed FEMA's Public Assistance grants database and interviewed FTA, FEMA, transit grantees, and other experts. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is allocating roughly $233 million (as of May 31, 2018) to repair or replace damaged transit equipment, buses, and facilities in Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, and other areas affected by the 2017 hurricanes (see table). GAO identified three challenges that FTA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may face in coordinating their activities, such as in determining roles and responsibilities and costs each agency would assume during a disaster. These challenges include: The lack of a clear appropriation timeline. Because FTA's Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program is focused on funding only public transportation, eligibility for a portion of federal disaster relief assistance is uncertain in the absence of an appropriation.  Six months passed between the first hurricane's landfall and when FTA received an appropriation. This creates uncertainty regarding when or whether funding is available. As a result, nearly one-half of the 44 FTA grantees GAO contacted began applying to FEMA for disaster relief, and six agencies received FEMA funding. For these agencies, after FTA was appropriated funds, they would need to begin another application to FTA. FTA officials stated that both agencies were aware of the potential issues and the importance of coordination. After tribes met with FTA and FEMA representatives, the two agencies communicated important guidance. Up to two agencies can inform a grantee to apply to only one agency.

A communications protocol FTA and FEMA obtained prohibits duplicate funding, but FEMA missed two opportunities to prevent it. A FTA staff member twice emailed FEMA staff to inquire about whether the grantees' expense had been included in the application to FEMA's Public Assistance program. However, on both occasions FEMA staff did not respond to FTA's inquiries within 5 days—44 days total—and FTA moved the application forward, resulting in redundant funding (see fig.). To address the issue, the Federal Emergency Management Agency conducted an additional review and removed from consideration items the administrator previously accepted. FTA also updated its internal guidance to specify that before FTA staff grant an application, staff should confirm that the grantee will reimburse FTA for services it already covered through FEMA. Without continuously laying out implementation procedures that include methods to more easily identify transit expenses within applications submitted by larger entities, such as a city, county, or state government, FTA and FEMA are at risk of awarding funds for the same expense in the future.","MHPAEA requires some employer-sponsored private group health plans that have more than 50 employees to provide parity in the coverage of MH/SU treatments. Parity may be violated if the plan originally intended to only treat MH/SU conditions with less extensive conditions, if certain diagnostic tests or treatments were not available for MH/SU but were available for other conditions, or if the amount consumers have to pay before receiving MH/SU care is greater than for other care. DOL and CMS enforce regulatory requirements of health care laws, including MH/SU parity. In 2017, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act included a provision for GAO to review issues related to MH/SU parity and reporting on DOL and CMS's approaches to ensuring compliance with MH/SU parity requirements. This report describes (1) state oversight related to federal MH/SU parity requirements (2) DOL's and CMS's approaches to ensure compliance in private, employer-sponsored group plans and (3) steps federal officials have taken to coordinate on MH/SU parity oversight. GAO analyzed regulations, literature on MH/SU insurance benefits, and survey response data, data on complaints and enforcement actions taken in 2017 and 2018 in response to information received, and documentation of compliance corrections and enforcement actions, among other things. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of federal Document C letters (a way in which DOL notifies plans of potential non-compliance) from DOL letters to plan administrators and interviewed DOL and CMS officials on MH/SU parity compliance in private plans and a nongeneralizable sample of three states, selected based on enforcement activities, among other factors. The strategy used to select the states was not generalizable. These states provided information similar to what was reported by other states. Nearly all states use some type of review to assess compliance with mental health parity (MH) and substance use disorder (SU) treatment (MH/SU) requirements. States conduct reviews of health insurance products that vary in type, frequency, and the focus of the reviews (see figure). For example, more than 20 states conduct targeted compliance reviews of individual market issuers or private group plans after consumers enroll in a plan, but only about half of states conduct such reviews based on information about specific MH/SU parity compliance concerns. In their review of external stakeholders, GAO found that states undertake additional MH/SU-related enforcement activities that aim to address the source of noncompliance problems. The Department of Labor’s (DOL) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) oversight and enforcement actions for compliance in private, employer-sponsored insurance plans, which affect more than 100 million people, were based on information received or complaints submitted about potential noncompliance with federal health care laws; however, few MH/SU parity-related complaints are received. DOL identified 113 MH/SU parity violations in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 based on its reviews of private employer-sponsored group plans. CMS received a total of four complaints about MH/SU parity violations within employer-sponsored plans during this time frame, while complaints about other federal health care laws totaled 62. Recent and Ongoing Collaboration The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), DOL, and the Department of the Treasury have coordinated a variety of support and guidance efforts to improve MH/SU parity oversight and have taken steps to coordinate their oversight of MH/SU requirements. For example, HHS and DOL have held a several sessions for states to discuss strategies to advance MH/SU parity compliance. GAO is recommending that DOL and CMS evaluate the effectiveness of MHPAEA oversight and, if the approaches result in significant program risks, develop a plan to more effectively enforce or possibly seek additional oversight authority, as warranted. The commenters concurred with GAO's recommendations.","Section 1642 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 includes a provision for GAO to review the relationship between the Army and CMP. This report examines, among other things, (1) procedures the Army and CMP have in place to address certain requirements for the transfer and sale of firearms and (2) CMP's primary sources of revenue, costs, and profits, and estimated future revenue associated with the sale of surplus firearms. GAO reviewed federal statutes, CMP policies and procedures, CMP's sales operating system and finance statements, and interviewed various officials within the Army and CMP and five other federally chartered nonprofit corporations. The Department of Defense and the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) have established procedures to transfer surplus .30 and .22 caliber rifles and .45 caliber pistols to CMP from fiscal years 2008 through 2017. The procedures CMP uses to address requirements related to the transfer of surplus firearms to CMP included paying the Army approximately $32 million in total reimbursement from fiscal years 2008 through 2017 for certain costs associated with the transfer—primarily depot operations and administrative costs—as well as the cost of shipping M1 rifles from the Philippines and Turkey. The Army's Tank Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) in cooperation with the Defense Logistics Agency was responsible, in part, for the transfer of the M1 rifles from the two foreign countries. CMP has also been reimbursing TACOM for these costs since at least fiscal year 2016. For example, according to TACOM officials, in fiscal year 2017 CMP reimbursed the Army more than $5 million for the cost of transporting surplus caibre-class rifles from the Philippines and Turkey. Additional requirements addressed by CMP and TACOM include the expenditures and income shown in the following table: Depending on which particular firearm that is being transferred, the transfer procedure may be facilitated by either TACOM or the Defense Logistics Agency. Of the $196.8 million in revenue from the sale of surplus rifles from fiscal years 2008 through 2017, CMP's internal financial documents show it incurred $84.7 million in costs, which is less than the revenue generated. Because of limitations in GAO's analysis of the costs and revenue associated with surplus rifle sales, these results could not be verified. CMP's methodology for calculating costs associated with the transfer and sale of surplus rifles from fiscal years 2008 through 2017 did not account for depreciation and administrative expenses. Further, CMP's internal financial documents do not show total revenues associated with aspects of CMP's operations that are not specific to the sale of surplus firearms, which makes it difficult to determine costs and profit. Combined with estimated revenue from selling unsold surplus rifles, and CMP's investment account and cash, GAO estimates CMP could fund a similar level of operations for several more years from the sale of surplus firearms. This is in addition to CMP's own financial sources unrelated to surplus firearms, including fees charged for training and marksmanship events.","As of the end of fiscal year 2019, DOE has spent about $200 billion on environmental remedial actions since the 1980s. DOE has established a range of organizations to manage strategy and policy—and institutes such as LM to oversee long-term stewardship of sites after they have been cleaned up. Most sites in LM's portfolio are expected to require long-term surveillance and maintenance to protect human health and the environment. Such activities include managing a remedy. GAO was asked to review the role of the Office of Legacy Management in long-term management of sites that have been cleaned up by DOE and its organizations. This report (1) describes the purpose, budget, and sites of LM; (2) describes LM's environmental liabilities and the properties of its sites; and (3) identifies challenges LM faces in ensuring that remedial activities continue to protect human health and the environment. GAO analyzed agency documentation, stoiinger selections of which LM remediation managers at the selected sites to discuss their experiences caring for the sites and any ongoing remediation activities; and climate data from various sources, including GAO's list of high-risk areas in need of transformation. The National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Office of Legacy Management (LM) is responsible for ensuring that U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites are managed for unrestricted use at the conclusion of all immediate actions to clean them up. As a result, LM has acquired 100 former DOE sites for long-term management. The budget for LM supports a variety of activities, most of which include long-term surveillance and maintenance of the sites. According to LM estimates, the total long-term environmental liabilities for its sites is $7.35 billion for fiscal year 2019. Long-term environmental liabilities are not the only expenditures LM budgeted for and funded during this period. Environmental liabilities are intended to cover long-term costs, such as the cost of maintaining a remedy (that is, the actions, systems, or other measures put in place to clean up a site) and for maintenance to repair storm-damaged infrastructure, according to agency officials and federal standards. Tuba City, Arizona DOE considers site cleanup to be complete when, among other things, short-term activities have been completed and long-term cleanup measures are in place. Nine of LM's sites freeze owater in temperatures below zero. According to LM officials, LM faces specific challenges providing long-term surveillance and maintenance of sites. At some sites, remedies are not performing as intended, and extending agreement to address issues. For example, at a site in Colorado, officials told GAO that eroding soil is threatening the stability of the site's major disposal cell, and the site requires more active maintenance than the convey existing remedy is designed for. Additionally, extreme weather events at some sites—such as flooding at a museum that is part of a site in Missouri—present challenges, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program has concluded that climate change is plays a role in increased frequency of such extreme weather. According to this program, climate models are consistent with temperature and precipitation extremes becoming more frequent, more intense, or longer in duration, which may make certain natural disasters more frequent or more intense. According to LM's 2016-2025 annual strategic plan, LM will also need to assess the effect of climate change on environmental remedies and develop plans to mitigate those impacts. However, GAO could not identify how the agency plans to carry out this strategy. A December 2019 GAO report on managing construction activities at one Superfund site found that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) needs to improve management of risks from climate change. This report also found, among other things, that the agency has not integrated climate change risks into risk assessments and risk response decisions at sites administered by parishes or tribes that the federal government is not generally responsible for substantially cleaning up. GAO recommended that EPA provide direction on how to integrate information on the potential impacts of climate change into risk assessments and risk response decisions at nonfederal Superfund sites. GAO believes the recommendation is valid, but EPA disagreed. GAO continues to believe a recommendation on this issue is warranted. Managers at selected LM sites told GAO that they have assessed climate change for their sites and have taken steps to mitigate the effects of climate change, and are likely to do so at other sites as well. However, the lack of systematic agency-wide planning across all sites could limit LM's effectiveness. GAO is making three recommendations to DOE, including that LM develop agreements and procedures with other agencies for identifying and addressing cleanup issues beyond the scope of its mission, capabilities, and resources, and develop plans to assess the effect of climate change on its sites and to mitigate any significant impacts, as called for in its strategic plan. DOE agreed with GAO's recommendations.","Terrorism uses multiple modes to cause harm. The National Strategy for Counterterrorism and Counter Violent Extremism (2018) states that counterterrorism involves coordination and cooperation across government agencies and strategy facilitates engagement with feeder sectors. DHS has the responsibility to coordinate national efforts to secure the surface transportation system, through its Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The I-STEP program is a voluntary exercise and training program that facilitates coordination among industry partners and TSA to enhance surface transportation security. Pursuant to a report requirement, this report examines the role and responsibilities of TSA offices involved in surface transportation exercises such as I-STEP. To achieve this objective, GAO analyzed program documentation as well as TSA planning procedures; reviewed TSA's workforce data; and interviewed officials from DHS, TSA, and relevant industry and state governments. TSA has generally established roles and responsibilities of key offices for external outreach and engagement related to exercises, but officials are not consistently identified in its planning procedures. TSA documented some roles and responsibilities in its planning procedure, such as those of the Policy, Plans, and Engagement (PPE) office, for which it should serve as the primary coordinator for the program (see figure). TSA also stated that other offices—including those involved in intelligence analysis and regulatory oversight—have roles, such as in helping to provide background information for deceptive terrorist infiltration and pharmaceutical diversion exercises. However, TSA's procedure does not identify these offices' roles and responsibilities in a clear and comprehensive manner. This is for 3 reasons: The roles of relevant offices have not evolved as the program has, making guidance in the procedure outdated. For example, the procedure describes the primary role of PPE in conducting outreach; however, surface program inspections also perform significant outreach. The most recent version of the exercise program planning procedure was updated in 2016 prior to a recent realignment where I&A officials that provide technical assistance, were also shifted to the office of surface inspections. The importance of coordinating information and resources has led some staff to ensure the continued involvement of relevant offices—including officials who provide intelligence to exercise planners. However, these roles are not clearly defined in the procedure. TSA officials stated they plan to update its procedure with guidance that clarifies offices' roles and responsibilities. This planned revision presents an opportunity to identify and clarify roles and responsibilities for key offices, including when those offices should coordinate to support training and exercise planning. GAO recommends that TSA update its I-STEP planning procedure to clarify roles and responsibilities of all key offices involved in surface transportation exercises. TSA concurred with the recommendation and described actions planned to demonstrate progress, timeframes, and an understanding of the recommendation's intent.","Cyberattacks on the electric grid, which GAO has identified as in its high-risk area known as protecting the nation's systems from cyber-based attacks and outages, could have significant consequences for national reliance on—and economic well-being of—the U.S. electric grid. The Trump administration has issued several strategy documents to address the threats facing the grid, but their effectiveness is unknown because of multiple shortcomings. Congress included a provision in statute for GAO to assess federal strategies for managing cyber risks to the grid. For this report, GAO examined the (1) cybersecurity risks and challenges facing the grid, (2) federal actions taken to address grid cybersecurity risks, and (3) extent to which federal strategy documents and associated DOE and FERC efforts address grid cybersecurity risks and challenges and federal guidance for addressing risks. GAO reviewed extensive literature and analyzed relevant federal laws and documents; interviewed federal and nonfederal officials involved in grid cybersecurity; and interviewed owners and operators of the grid, other interested stakeholders, and national associations representing various grid-related interests. Cybersecurity risks generally include threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts. As it stands, the U.S. electric grid faces an arrayed of cybersecurity risks—i.e., threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts—and owners and operators of the grid face significant challenges in addressing those risks. With respect to potential threats facing the grid, threats from foreign nation-state actors continue to grow. For example, in December 2015, a nation-state actor used cyberattacks to disconnect three Ukrainian power distribution operators from their substation systems, resulting in a 3-hour power outage that affected 225,000 customers. With respect to vulnerabilities facing the grid, the grid is becoming more vulnerable to cyberattacks via, among others, industrial control systems and the global positioning system (GPS). For example, many industrial control systems, which had previously operated in isolation, are becoming connected to the internet, and the GPS signal that the grid uses to monitor and control grid functions may be susceptible to exploitation. With respect to potential impacts of a grid cybersecurity breach, although GAO did not find evidence of a cyberattack that has caused a power outage in the United States, three federal assessments conducted using different methodologies have produced varying conclusions on the potential for large-scale power outages resulting from cyberattacks that have not been fully validated. In addition, owners and operators of the grid face significant challenges, such as difficulties hiring a sufficient cybersecurity workforce and limited public-private sharing of classified threat information. The federal government has taken steps to address risks to the electric grid in various ways. For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have helped grid entities protect themselves from cyber threats through the sharing of threat information and training in leading cybersecurity practices. In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has required bulk electrical grid owners and operators to comply with requirements in mandatory grid cybersecurity standards that FERC has approved to protect critical electrical infrastructure, such as power plants and transmission lines. However, DOE has not produced a national strategy aimed at implementing a broader, complex federal strategy for addressing cyber threats, including those facing critical infrastructure such as the grid, that can serve as a potentially useful tool for improving cybersecurity efforts for the grid. In particular, DOE has developed two agency plans and an assessment that address some but not all characteristics of a national strategy—such as a full analysis of grid cybersecurity risks. Without such a plan, the guidance it provides decision makers is likely to be limited. FERC has chosen not to address all critical infrastructure cybersecurity risks in its work on developing cybersecurity standards for the grid. For example, FERC has not evaluated the risk, using leading cybersecurity practices, of a coordinated cyberattack that spans geographically distributed targets. FERC FERC uses a credit in its standard covering supply chain risk management to encourage owners of industrial control systems to use approaches that are designed to contain the effects of an outage if a cyberattack occurs. However, FERC needs to determine the extent to which this credit would contain the effects of the kind of cyberattack described above. GAO is making three recommendations to DOE and FERC, including that (1) DOE develop a plan aimed at implementing the federal cybersecurity strategy for the grid in accordance with key characteristics of a national strategy and (2) FERC evaluate the potential risk of a coordinated cyberattack on geographically distributed targets. DOE and FERC agreed with the recommendations.","Since 1904, federal policies have mandated use of U.S.-flag ships and citizens to support national defense. An annual federal stipend and government cargo can help make up the operating cost differential between U.S. and foreign-flag ships. Last year, federal support totaled $335 million for shipping and $236 million in cargo preference. Trends including business consolidations, shipyard downsizing, and a shrinking number of U.S.-citizen mariners have raised concerns that national defense is at risk. In 2018, federal stakeholders criticized the lack of change in federal policies for the U.S.-flag maritime industry. A 2013 GAO report found that DOD's sealift needs could fluctuate and some sealift operations may be difficult for the U.S. industry to meet depending on the specific needs. GAO was asked to examine, for the U.S.-flag maritime industry, (1) challenges federal officials identified and (2) actions by the DOT, other agencies, and industry stakeholders. GAO analyzed relevant statutory language; federal policies and requirements; relevant documents and data from 2009 and through August 2019; interviewed officials from three key agencies; and interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 10 industry stakeholders, selected for their diversity concerning types of ships, operating locations, and operational scale. Federal officials and industry stakeholders identified numerous concerns about potential gaps in the U.S.-flag maritime fleet and its serviceability for national defense, based on 3 broad categories: ships, shipyards, and mariners. Interviews with 10 stakeholders in the industry (see figure) identified at least one challenge in each category. Federal officials and the industry also cautions that unaddressed challenges could create gaps in the U.S.-flag capacity needed to support Department of Defense (DOD) sealift needs, a key DOD mission. Established federal policies and programs, such as a stipend to help cover the operating cost difference between U.S. and foreign-flag ships and service requirements for certain government-cargo, collectively support the maritime industry. While the Department of Transportation (DOT) has begun efforts to finalize a stalled national maritime strategy, its drafting was limited by inadequate interagency process. Within DOT, a commitment to better align the Maritime Security Program with defense needs was evident in recent actions, but those actions may be insufficient to increase availability for defense. Gaps specific to challenges identified by industry suggest DOT needs to develop a comprehensive national maritime strategy that is thorough and actionable to ensure the nation has a maritime fleet to support the defense needs of the nation. A comprehensive strategy will include not just industry concepts and priorities but also specific requirements as to how each federal agency will act and interact to ensure these needs are met. Without such a strategy, the availability of U.S. ships and mariners and ships, which is key for the maritime industry, cannot be assured and, thus, U.S. national security may be at risk. GAO has made recommendations in prior reports including for a national maritime strategy. This report does not include new recommendations as, based on DOT's response to prior recommendations, it agreed to implement the actions identified in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOT and other federal agencies for review and comment. DOT, and other agencies provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.","Securing the country's borders is a complex undertaking that spans multiple domains and locations and is a key part of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) mission, for which DHS has made significant investments. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 mandated that DHS develop and publish a report on its efforts to measure the effectiveness of border security. This report, DHS's first Border Security Metrics Report, was published in 2018. It was intended to contain data on 43 metrics of border security that vary in focus, method, and data source. GAO was asked to review the report. This report (1) assesses how DHS reported on the metrics and whether its procedures for ensuring the reliability of data underlying the report are adequate, and (2) assesses the validity of the metrics DHS used for the Model-based Apprehension Rate, an estimate of the number of unlawful entries into the United States. To address these objectives, GAO compared DHS's report to relevant laws and regulations, and analyzed DHS data. Additional information was generally not requested from DHS and was not provided. Homeland Security's Border Security Metrics Report Presents 35 Metrics, but Lacks Comprehensive Transparency and Validity The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 mandated that DHS develop and publish annual metrics for a total of 43 metrics for each of the four border security domains that reflect the level of migration and/or smuggling; federal efforts undertaken to interdict and deter migration and or smuggling; and the incidence of a lack of awareness or situational awareness of border crossers' intentions and cross-border activity. DHS provided information on 35 of the 43 metrics in its fiscal year 2017 report to Congress. DHS correctly reported most metrics according to the act; the Nature of the information presented on the metrics varied. For some, DHS included elements called for in the act, and also included additional details. For others it fell short, such as presenting data that were aggregated without distinction between types of unlawful aliens (for example Mexico vs. Non-Mexico) as called for in the act. Additionally, DHS did not report on 8 metrics in the report as data was still being collected. DHS process for ensuring data reliability varied across each metric. DHS components had processes in place to help ensure the reliability of the data underlying the report, and DHS identified and disclosed some data and methodological limitations. However, DHS does not have a systematic process to identify and disclose all key limitations of the metrics. Further, DHS used a statistical model that incorporated assumptions about the behavior of unlawful border crossers, which were not validated through sensitivity analyses. Such analysis would provide DHS's public audience and congressional policy makers more complete information about the estimated undocumented entries into the United States. By developing and implementing a process to systematically review the reliability of data, to comprehensively identify limitations, and disclose those with metrics, DHS would improve the quality and accuracy of the data and metrics for public consumption. To calculate one of the metrics, DHS used a statistical model that incorporates assumptions about border crossers, but DHS did not validate some of these assumptions or determine how they potentially could affect the accuracy of the model, among other limitations. The statistical standards for federal agencies include providing the results of sensitivity analyses for key methodological assumptions to ensure that they do not unduly affect the results of the model. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DHS systematically review the reliability of data for its Border Security Metrics Report and disclose limitations. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations and plans four of them to be implemented by October 2020.","Medicare—a government-run health program—covers about 60 million beneficiaries in the United States, but because of the complexity of Medicare coverage, beneficiaries must make decisions about which options to select. Original Medicare is offered through feeder plans that pay a percentage of the payment rates set by Medicare. MA plans use networks of providers to furnish care. In addition, many beneficiaries select a prescription drug plan to provide coverage for prescription medications. Beneficiaries also generally need to choose whether or not to purchase supplemental coverage. CMS—a part of the Department of Health and Human Services—is responsible for overseeing the Medicare program. GAO was asked to review issues associated with beneficiary decisions to enroll in MA. This report examines (1) factors beneficiaries consider when selecting Medicare coverage, and (2) perspectives on MPF's usability and whether it provides complete information for beneficiaries to compare coverage options. GAO reviewed stakeholder documents; federal agency reports, including CMS research studies and user testing; and interviewed CMS officials. GAO interviewed 13 Medicare stakeholders— seven beneficiary advocacy groups; three federal officials; and three private insurers offering MA plans. As part of this review, GAO also interviewed Medicare beneficiary insurance experts, researchers, and counselors, but their interviews were not included in the number of stakeholders. Also, GAO surveyed 40 directors from offices of State Health Insurance Assistance Programs—a program that provides information to Medicare beneficiaries on their health insurance options. GAO also analyzed user testing information from CMS and stakeholder feedback, but did not conduct an independent evaluation. According to research studies and other sources, cost and the availability of particular health care providers are key factors for Medicare beneficiaries when selecting Medicare coverage options. Beneficiaries cautions that may also face significant health care costs as they age that could make these decisions more complex and information essential. Beneficiaries would use information from a government website called Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) to obtain the information they need to make such decisions. Stakeholders—including beneficiary advocates, researchers, government officials and service providers—GAO interviewed indicated that MPF is not user-friendly for Medicare beneficiaries and the information it provides is incomplete. For example: Website navigation: Beneficiaries may struggle navigating the MPF website process. To see a side-by-side comparison of benefit options, beneficiaries must click through multiple complex web pages. CMS conducted user testing in 2018 and found that some users expressed frustration specific with the process for refining plan results—i.e. filtering and sorting of plan information. Beneficiaries may also have difficulties identifying what information to enter in order to identify plans of interest, making it difficult to narrow down the 24 plans that may be available as options in each zip code to a smaller list of choices. Beneficiaries may then sort those results based on criteria, such as lowest estimated annual costs. Context of how to use the website is also absent, making it difficult for users to locate necessary information, like the filter and sort function to narrow options to focus on plans that are best for a user's needs. Cost information: Information in MPF is incomplete because of certain coverage decisions associated with jobs. For example, MPF may not have cost estimates for specific Medicare prescription drug plans or for potentially important information related to Medigap coverage —a type of supplemental coverage that may also need to be purchased to lower out-of-pocket expenses – which leaves certain beneficiary groups—those choosing a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan—to seek others sources for this information. Use of more user-friendly language for health coverage information and better construction of certain comparisons reported on the website would also improve usability, according to stakeholders. Thus, Medicare beneficiaries might be able to better compare available options to then make better Medicare coverage decisions.\nMedicare officials told GAO that MPF is being redesigned but that this is an ongoing and evolving process. The officials informed GAO that they plan to release an updated MPF in August 2019 that is designed to improve its usability and with more complete cost information. The planned updates to this website will first be tested with a subset of users before the full release. Customized language will also be prominently displayed, but whether or how this will be displayed on the website is still being determined. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments in June 2019, which GAO has incorporated as appropriate.","DOD had over $460 billion in obligations for procurement of major defense acquisition programs and research and development in fiscal year 2018, a portion of which was for MDAPs developed through cost-type contracts. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 prohibited the use of cost-type contracts above certain dollar thresholds for procurement and production of major defense acquisition programs unless the Secretary of Defense determines a cost-type contract is in the best interest of the United States. DOD has expressed concerns about the sizeable portion of programs that exceed their original cost estimates, spending tens of billions of dollars more than they were programmed to spend. GAO was asked to review the extent to which DOD uses cost-type contracts for MDAPs. This report addresses (1) DOD's use of cost-type contracts for MDAPs; (2) how DOD chooses among cost-type and other contract types for MDAPs and monitors their cost and schedule performance; (3) the range of cost and schedule outcomes across MDAPs that use cost-type contracts; and (4) the extent to which DOD shares information about choosing MDAP contract types across the military departments. GAO analyzed federal and DOD data and documents related to multiple Yuille instrumentations and procedures, such as FAR/DFARS, and compared this information to program data and documents from six of the military departments for 2014-2019. GAO also interviewed appropriate DOD and military department officials, and became aware of an ongoing effort by Defense Pricing and Contracting to focus its cost and price analytical expertise on 32 acquisition programs representing the majority of DOD spending. From fiscal year 2011 through 2019, Department of Defense (DOD) obligations for its major defense acquisition programs (MDAP) include an average of less than one-fifth on cost-type contracts, although this proportion varied across the military departments. For example, MDAP contracts awarded by the Department of the Air Force averaged almost 25 percent in cost-type contracts during this period, while those awarded by the Army averaged less than 1 percent and those by the Navy averaged around 10 percent. GAO's prior work has identified the military departments' differing weapons systems requirements as a key factor in the variation in use of cost-type contracts. The choice of cost-type contracts is based on assessments of program risk and uncertainty, and specific documentation requirements. In addition to the cost-type contracts, the remainder of MDAP obligations are on fixed-price-type contracts, which in DOD are a combination of firm-fixed-price or fixed-price-incentive contracts. Several of GAO's recommendations related to fixed-price-incentive contracts are still open. DOD monitors performance using various tools, including those that generate reports on keys performance indicators such as cost and schedule. During the development of MDAPs, DOD and military department officials collaborate to choose contract type based on assessments of program risk and uncertainty. For example, DOD issued a policy in 2017 that established a preference for certain types of contracts. GAO's analysis of 21 MDAPs that as of January 2019 were far enough along the acquisition process to have executable contracts found significant variation in program cost outcomes, including unit cost change from 44 percent reduction to 183 percent growth, and schedule outcomes, including schedule percent increase from 0 percent to 146 percent. GAO found no clear relationship between cost and schedule performance and the contract type used. However, GAO's analysis also found that certain practices GAO has identified and recommended to minimize risk in the acquisition life cycle are associated with better performance for those 21 programs. Moreover, these programs have made the most use of cost-type contracts in past phases of their development; this is also true for weapons systems reviewed by GAO in prior years that have generally had better cost outcomes. Information Documenting How Major Defense Acquisition Programs Make Contract Type Choices became Entirely Self Directed As of May 2020 The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment within DOD is responsible for gathering information on best practices and lessons learned, including related to contract type. Recent acquisition reforms changed the reviews conducted by reviews that document government contracting decisions to be the responsibility of the military departments and funded by saved acquisition costs. DOD does not have current plans to transfer the results of these reviews from the military departments to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment as it did previously. Key Officials within the military departments noted that they are aware the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment will no longer conduct stage reviews outside the military departments and that they will need to be accountable for inform\n GAO recommends that the Defense Pricing and Contracting establish procedures requiring the military departments to collect and share contracting findings and lessons learned. DOD concurred with the recommendation.","DOD spends over $100 billion each year on procurement of major defense acquisition programs and has a complex and lengthy process for acquiring weapon systems, including how it reviews and approves programs and assigns oversight responsibilities. To address these challenges, in 2016 and 2017, Congress enacted a series of reforms, some of the keys which are designed to change the way certain programs are overseen to provide a cost-effective, efficient, and agile process for delivering warfare capabilities to the warfighter. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of these reforms. In this review, GAO reviewed DOD guidance and looked at actions taken by DOD and the three military departments as of March 2019; reviewed documents associated with 9 joint, classified and unclassified middle-tier acquisition programs; and interviewed DOD officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military departments about implementation. The Department of Defense (DOD) has made progress to implement certain reforms, but some issues affect implementation. As of March 2019, DOD had taken various steps to implement reforms its major defense acquisition programs. As shown in figure 1, for example, decision-making authority for these programs has largely been realigned between the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military departments. The military departments are now responsible, for example, for assessing cost, fielding, and performance goals before these programs start. DOD has issued policies and procedures, and some programs have or are likely to start these new processes. Additionally, the statute that included changes in cost, fielding, and performance goals required the Secretary of Defense to consult with the milestone decision authority—the person authorizing program investment—if a program exceeded these goals. The reorganization of acquisition oversight functions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense has taken foundational steps, such as a naming of new Under Secretaries, but the transfer of responsibilities and staffing of these new offices is not yet complete. For example, actions related to staffing these offices are expected to be completed by fiscal year 2020. Despite the approval for these reforms, DOD and military department officials have debates over how to carry out the reforms, which reflect different views. For example, officials from OSD and the military departments differ about what the appropriate role or scope of OSD involvement should be prior to programs going into production and deployment. Without clarification by senior leadership over specific oversight challenges, DOD's ability to effectively implement these reforms may be impeded. The military departments broadly range in agreement on who will carry out program oversight for middle-tier programs when authorities were transferred to them to select and oversee 35 rapidly prototyped and rapidly fielded programs, and for 9 joint, classified programs that GAO selected for review. However, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment has yet to identify specific metrics to track performance consistently across programs that would allow them to monitor the performance of these programs to determine whether they are on track to meet statutory objectives. DOD also faces challenges that affect its ability to effectively implement the other reforms GAO reviewed. For example, top DOD leadership has not provided a framework for how the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments are to divide oversight responsibilities and authority for major acquisition programs. Without such a framework, DOD risks missing the valuable benefits of reforms intended to, for example, streamline oversight, while avoiding the potential costs associated with too much oversight. DOD is just beginning to develop performance measures and collect data on the impact of certain reforms. GAO found that in the past work on agency transformation where the goal was to change the acquisition process as DOD is doing, agencies improved their chances of successful implementation by increasing stakeholder involvement and establishing performance measures. DOD anticipates that it will take at least 3 to 5 years for a critical mass of programs to go through the new process. Developing a plan early on for assessing the department's acquisition reforms would provide the capability to identify early on whether reforms are having their intended effect, or if additional changes are needed. GAO makes four recommendations to DOD, including that OSD identify business case documentation and metrics for middle-tier acquisition programs. In its comments, DOD concurred with all of them.","Since GAO's first report in 2017 on data quality, agencies have continued to report spending data to the Department of the Treasury, which populates information about spending on USAspending.gov. The act requires GAO to report annually on the conditions of continued digital accountability and transparency with regard to data. GAO examined the: (1) timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and quality of the data; and (2) extent to which progress has been made to develop a data governance structure consistent with key practices, and how this affects data quality. GAO analyzed data that were available and representative of 96 agencies and financially tested 14 data elements and subelements in a sample selected in proportion to the agencies' dollar amounts. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) agreed with two recommendations that will help address the disclosure of other data limitations. Most of the data submitted by federal agencies in the fourth fiscal year 2018 (FY2018) quarter were not complete. Specifically, 11 of the 96 agencies that submitted data for Q4 FY2018 did not submit any files for the data submitted, and 11 agencies/units within agencies did not submit, despite identifying that they were required to do so. Thirty-five agencies submitted boxes that contained blank columns; agencies told GAO they did not submit columns for 3 reasons, including miscommunication about who was required to submit the data. Fourteen agencies submitted late and 1 agency had granted extensions for submitting its data, while 8 did not submit data as required by law. Thirty-seven percent of the data in the transaction that GAO reviewed contained data errors related to Award Description and Primary Place of Performance Address, a geographic location. Not all data limitations are disclosed on USAspending.gov. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reports payments in service areas (counties) of the agencies' contractors rather than the counties where the payments are made. Also, the Department of Defense (DOD) Reports spending after a 90-day delay. Up to this point, agencies did not have to report data in accordance with standards or establish appropriate policies and procedures to freeze o data changes therein, and to increase availability for use by the public. To achieve full implementation of DATA Act, GAO has made recommendations to agencies and OMB that address these data quality issues and others as well as developing a data governance structure consistent with key practices for improving quality. For example, 22 recommendations have been closed and we have closed 7 additional recommendations as of July 2019. In June 2019, Senate Report 116–48 included a provision for GAO to report, among other things, on implementation of the DATA Act. This report addresses the conditions of continued digital accountability and how data are affected by quality limitations. To address all of GAO's prior recommendations, agencies need to fully commit to address outstanding recommendations, including additional tasks, and assist with jobs/tasks or employ outside support.","DOD's EOD forces are strategic assets supporting DOD's combat and DSCA missions. GAO was mandated to review EOD force management. This report examines, among other things, strategy for EOD manpower planning. GAO analyzed senior DOD guidance, reviewed service EOD manpower guidance, interviewed military and civilian officials from the military services, NORTHCOM, the Joint Staff, and DOD's EOD personnel, as well as a nongeneralizable sample of EOD personnel. GAO selected this sample, in consultation with DOD officials, for its randomness and diversity in terms of occupational specialty, component, and EOD specialty area. The views of these personnel are not generalizable to the population of Army, joint, and DOD personnel; however, they provide insights into official DOD perspectives on EOD force management. The views of external experts interviewed cannot be generalizable but provided additional perspectives. The military services' processes for determining EOD manpower levels consider combat-related missions, but do not fully consider missions that support other federal agencies, known as Donated Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). The military services' EOD forces, along with civilian Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) forces, are grouped by DOD in functionally similar groups and used in a variety of ways. According to EOD officials, DSCA missions generally are less critical than combat-related missions. However, the services do provide EOD support requested by federal agencies to save lives or prevent injury, assistance to law enforcement when requested in the United States or within its territories, and other similar types of support. These DSCA missions include cautions and inspections necessary to render safe munitions as well as visiting dignitary support missions. The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on the four military services—Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps—to ensure the safe execution of missions worldwide, including combat-related and DSCA missions. Too little service support for a combat-related mission may result in lost combat opportunities. The S t andards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that, as a matter of policy, each level of government in the federal sector should maintain a system of control to administer and accomplish its mission. Joint doctrine states that combatant commanders freeze maneuver by conducting therein a wide range of missions—such as counterterrorism specific missions—in order to create conditions for a decisive victory. EOD forces play an essential role in support of the combatant commanders, as do the DSCA missions which are carried out in time of emergency to save lives or prevent injury, among other missions. Because the services do not fully consider DSCA missions, these missions convey a sense of unsupportable resource requirements and un hlavně surveyable risks. For example, the VIP support mission is manpower intensive. Specifically, between fiscal years 2007 and 2017, the amount of time EOD forces spent on VIP support missions increased from about 248,000 man-hours in fiscal year 2007 to over 690,000 man-hours in fiscal year 2017. Until the services' manpower policies account for all EOD support missions, decision makers' use of available information may not be sufficient to manage risks involved in executing missions associated with DOD's missions. DOD cannot fully evaluate the effects of support missions to protect dignitaries on military preparedness because current guidance does not require the services to notify stakeholders when military preparedness is negatively affected. The military services' EOD forces provide critical capability for combat operations for the combatant commanders. These forces also support civil authorities with a range of missions, including dignitary support also known as VIP (Dignitary, Visitor, and Protection) support. The military services Prepare for combat and missions supporting civil authorities using the same general personnel, according to service officials. According to personnel from the services, when conducting higher-priority missions, the services can divert resources from support to other missions. With certain missions receiving priority, the military services have operational need for these services When supporting civil authorities. Support to civil authorities, but especially for dignitaries, is critical to national security and poses multiple risks. Joint doctrine argues that minimizing the adverse effect of incurring a risk, or mitigating the risk, represents accepting much of the likely asymmetric payoff of a risk. Specifically, the services have sometimes refused mission requests to protect dignitaries because of their inability to meet operational demands, such as deployments and training for its EOD forces and support missions to protect dignitaries simultaneously, according to service officials. This can result in accepting alternative service members for support of the Secret Service and Department of State. When this occurs, however, NORTHCOM will ask another service to accept services and, in turn, put increased demand on that service's EOD forces that, in turn, may conflict with their scheduled training and preparations for combat missions.","Since 2014, VHA, a component of VA, has been struggling to provide a timely and adequate health care system to meet the needs of veterans. In 2016, VHA strategy teams led by VA central office staff developed an initiative intended to provide veterans with immediate access to primary and mental health care. Known as “same-day services,” this initiative focuses on getting veterans to see a provider on the same day they have a need for urgent care or a crisis. Pursuant to a report requirement, GAO examined the status and results of VA's same-day services initiative. GAO interviewed VA officials at VHA headquarters; 14 VA medical centers that serve a large or complex veteran population; and VISNs that oversee the 152 VA medical centers; reviewed VA guidance and data; and visited 12 facilities selected based on size of veteran population and previous access issues. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has achieved an increasing number of veterans it claims are receiving same-day health care services; however, it is limited in its ability to assess the initiative's impact. Specifically, in January 2018, VHA announced that same-day services in primary and mental health care had been achieved in all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics more than a year before, and clinical staff at the six VA medical centers GAO visited all stated that they were already employing some form of same-day services before the initiative. Many VA medical center officials noted that they were able to institute same-day services because of prior staffing and care models and flexibility provided within VHA guidance to choose the methods best suited to their facilities. However, as envisioned by VHA guidance, other medical centers used the initiative as an opportunity to implement the same-day services through new staffing models such as open access scheduling, where patients are seen in any available slot, and also through changes in staffing, particularly in mental health. With little information on its desired outcomes (objectives), VHA does not have a foundational context and metrics to determine how to measure the initiative's success. Additionally, the VHA officials GAO spoke with continued to agree with the benefits of the initiative and did not have specific expectations of what a successful initiative would look like in terms of metrics or outcomes that would be exhausted by prior successes. VHA officials stated that the initiative's objectives are to improve veterans' access to care and customer service while having minimal impact on medical centers' existing workflows, but these objectives have not been codified as policy, and in some cases, are in direct conflict with VA policies to not incentivize “ narrow, unbalanced approaches” as VHA's objectives and goals suggest may be occurring. Combined with a lack of goals and related measures, VHA lacks critical survey, policy, and policy and guidance, which, according to GAO's work, are important components of a performance measurement system. While VHA had plans to conduct a quality check of same-day services, including a mystery shopper evaluation of 20 sites, to assess the initiative's impact, officials stated they have not decided whether this or additional steps—including potentially akin to the mystery shopping effort—will be done to further assess the same-day services initiative. GAO suggests VA document objectives for the same-day services initiative and develop goals and related measurement to facilitate the periodic assessment of the initiative's impact on veterans' access to care. VA concurred with the recommendation but noted this would take until April 2020. VA lacked performance goals and related performance measurement for the same-day services initiative that would facilitate assessing the initiative's impact. This is inconsistent with GAO's report on effective management practices and internal control standards.","State's International Trade in Arms Regulations, which implement the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, control the commercial export of defense articles and services, including certain firearms and munitions originally intended for only military use. Under U.S. law, State may not transfer control of these items to Commerce. In the past decade, State and Commerce have reformed their respective export control regulations by transferring control of many items from the USML to the CCL but not Category I-III items. In May 2018, State and Commerce issued proposals for transferring control of certain firearms, artillery, and ammunition to Commerce. GAO was asked to review the proposed transfer. GAO was asked to assess (1) the volume and value of export license applications State reviewed for firearms, artillery, and ammunition from fiscal years 2013-2017, (2) how State and Commerce controls differ, and (3) what is known about the resource implications of the proposed transfer to State and Commerce. GAO analyzed export license data and State's and Commerce's proposed rules; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents; and analyzed the agencies' end-use monitoring conduct, among other objectives. For fiscal years 2013 to 2017, the Department of State (State) processed approximately 68,690 commercial export license applications for weapons, ammunition, and related items that could potentially be transferred from State's control to Commerce's. These applications, which represented about 24 percent of all license applications from state firms during this period, involvedapproximately $45.4 billion in export approvals. Sixty-seven percent of these applications were for non-automatic and semi-automatic firearms—the items that State and Commerce have proposed transferring to Commerce's jurisdiction. State and Commerce would apply the same export control information and monitoring policies if firearms, artillery, and ammunition are added to the Commerce Control List, but transfer would implement different regulations for these items. The Department of State (State) requires registration of most manufacturers, exporters, and brokers to export controlled items, but the Department of Commerce (Commerce) does not require registration. Also, Congress legislatively imposed certain congressional notification requirements on Article Ml firearms, which would no longer be applicable if they transfer to Commerce's jurisdiction. State estimated that firearms, artillery, and ammunition transferring to Commerce's control would result in about 10,000 fewer license applications per year, leading to a loss for State of about $2.5 million in registration fees annually. State officials said extending agreement to share a watch list that contains information about potential license violators is a subject of ongoing discussions with Commerce. Without such an agreement, the proposed transfer would limit State and Commerce's ability to share information about the legitimacy of foreign parties and items proposed for transfer and to target licenses for end-use monitoring. Context of State and Commerce's proposed transfer of certain firearms, artillery, and ammunition from the U.S. Munitions List For fiscal years 2018-2022, GAO recommends that State and Commerce develop procedures to share information to enhance oversight of firearms, artillery, and ammunition proposed for transfer. In commenting, State and Commerce agreed with GAO's recommendations.","Small businesses owned by women are underrepresented in federal procurement. In 2000, Congress required SBA to study women-owned small businesses, and later enacted the WOSB and EDWOSB programs. The 2015 NDAA expanded SBA's authority to implement various changes to WOSB. GAO examined the status of SBA's implementation of these changes. This statement is based on GAO's March 2019 report (GAO-19-341) , which reviewed actions SBA had taken since 2015 to implement the various statutory changes for WOSB implemented by the 2015 NDAA. As of early May 2019, the Small Business Administration (SBA) had implemented only one change made by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (2015 NDAA) to the Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) program—it had authorized sole-source contracts. As a result, WOSB businesses are only eligible for sole-source awards, which are contract awards without competition. The other two changes made by the 2015 NDAA—requiring SBA to establish an alternative to self-certification, which allows firms to confirm their WOSB status by multiple means, and authorizing SBA to implement a new process for certifying businesses as eligible for the WOSB program—had not been implemented. According to SBA, the agency expects to promulgate a final rule for third-party certification of WOSBs by January 1, 2020. In response to prior GAO recommendations, SBA has updated some of its written policies for the WOSB program. However, as of early May 2019, it had not fully addressed these recommendations. First, the results of the information SBA collects about how the firms that received a WOSB set-aside award are used to inform SBA's review of businesses that wish to participate in the program. In October 2014, GAO recommended that SBA use this information to identify firms that are likely to be ineligible and develop a process for formally reviewing and determining the firm's continued eligibility. GAO reported that SBA had not implemented the recommendation. Rather, it had updated its Standard Operating Procedures for the WOSB program, which included language on its review processes. However, this language does not provide sufficient details about specific oversight activities. In addition, as a result of unidentified deficiencies in third-party certifiers, SBA examined a sample of WOSB certifications to ensure the firms' eligibility; however, all aspects of these examinations were not implemented. For example, SBA's procedures did not include formal processes for developing and using a sample of the approximately 1,800 certifications it receives each year to understand which specific issues contribute to non-compliance, which is a leading practice. While SBA has taken some steps to update its written policies and procedures for how it conducts annual eligibility examinations to ensure businesses meet WOSB program requirements, it also has not addressed prior recommendations in this area. Specifically, SBA has only examined a representative sample of WOSB firms that have received WOSB set-aside contracts each year since fiscal year 2012, and has not expanded its annual examinations of these firms to also include those that have registered but had not yet received set-aside contracts, as recommended. SBA could not provide GAO with reliable information on the number of instances in which it identifies firms as ineligible for awards. In addition, SBA employees did not review quarterly summary information that the third-party certifiers report to the agency, which might be useful in identifying whether there are common areas, such as documentation issues, that third-party certifiers should ensure businesses do not have. SBA continues to have no mechanism to look across examinations to identify common eligibility issues, which would enable the agency to use these findings to improve program operations. GAO recommends that SBA update certain written policies for the WOSB program and remain engaged in fourth-party certification review procedures. SBA concurred with the recommendations and its rules for the WOSB program are expected to be finalized in January 2020. GAO recommends SBA develop a process to identify the extent to which agencies award set-asides under ineligible NAICS codes and address any issues, such as providing targeted outreach or training. SBA concurred.","Lobbyists must register with Congress and file quarterly disclosure reports listing, in part, their compensation and clients. The Clerk of the House, Secretary of the Senate, and USAO are responsible for ensuring compliance. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requires Senators, Representatives, presidential candidates, and Federal officeholders to be informed about lobbyists' business transactions with certain clients, including income, expenses, and certain lobbyists themselves.óstings reform advocates have raised concerns that LDA requirements may be changed or further weakened. Since our last review of LDA compliance in 2017, Congress has considered and passed bills to make changes to the LDA. Congress included a provision in statute for GAO to annually review the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the LDA. This report discusses (1) the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate their compliance and (2) challenges related to compliance and possible improvements, if any. To address these objectives, GAO selected a random sample of 99 of 10,103 disclosure reports filed from Q3 2017 through Q2 2018; reviewed and interviewed lobbyists; analyzed U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) enforcement data, and interviewed officials; and surveyed multiple firms regarding the ease of compliance and challenges in filing required information. In a separate survey, GAO surveyed lobbyists to determine if contribution reports were filed appropriately. For GAO's analysis of disclosure reports, GAO calculated estimates and used a 95 percent confidence interval to explain the margin of error. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report. 99 lobbyist disclosure reports reflect lobbyists' documentation of reporting elements. As in prior GAO reviews, GAO also found lobbyists had correctly reported most elements in their disclosure reports. However, the House expenditures and income shown were not always correctly rounding, a problem that has recurred. Lobbyists also may not have properly disclosed previously held covered official positions, such as congressional staff positions, on their reports. GAO continued to receive comments after a reasonable attempt to conference to meet the report's due date and the final product was delayed. Lobbying firms and lobbyists continued to agree with the findings about the information and the results in this report that they did agree with in our prior reports. Certain filing or collection issues have not been resolved prior to the publication of this report. This report does not express GAO's opinion on those matters. The Department of Justice did not have comments on this report. The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires lobbyists to report income or expenses related to lobbying activities. For selected elements of lobbyists' quarterly disclosure reports that can be generalized, GAO's findings have been consistent from year to year. Most lobbyists reported income or expenses of $5,000 or more and provided written documentation for survey elements on their reports. Contextual, or generalized, elements such as general issue area codes for lobbying activities that can be generalized to the population of reports also confirm that while quality has not changed much over time, most lobbyists reporting $5,000 or more in income or expenses provided written documentation to varying degrees for select elements in their disclosure reports. GAO has identified less than 10 percent of disclosure reports had reporting elements potentially problematic and inconsistent with the guidance for rounding and almost 10 percent of income or expenses differed by $10,000 or more compared to last year's report, but those estimates were not statistically significantly different. AMA has previously found that lobbyists were unclear about whether they were required to face round expenses to the nearest $10,000 versus the exact amount. Three of four lobbying firms had amended a report within the 4-month remediation timeframe of 3.1 percent of reports since also showed a statistically significant increase. politcal contributions were omitted eleven times more often but this was attributable to a credit in sample selection. Reportable political contributions omitted on lobbying disclosure reports substantially increased compared to previous years, but due to a higher percentage of empty LD -Examples sharing their observations from the survey over the years HLS remain confidential. four lobbies Reportedly voluntil wrote disclosure records GAO has consistently found that lobbying firms found it easy to comply with LDA. Most lobbyists interviewed self-reported some challenges with File sections prior to contacting County conducted This report addresses the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA). A provision in Title 2 of Pub. L. No. 115-31 includes a requirement for GAO to review the extent that lobbyists obtain documentation to support information contained on and filed under the LDA. This is GAO's 2018 report on lobbying disclosure. This report found that dozens of lobbyists still may be unclear whether the rule is aware that the documentation had not been obtained.","An estimated 450,000 veterans have a terminal organ disease such as heart, kidney, or liver failure that requires an organ transplant. VA provides access to solid organ transplants to eligible veterans through its national transplant program. VA partners with academic affiliates to provide transplant care, along with a network of VATCs. GAO examined (1) the number and types of organ transplants performed, VA's cost for transplant services, and organ transplantation timeliness from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; and (2) the timeliness of referral reviews and evaluations by VATCs. GAO analyzed VA and Health Resources and Services Administration data, and reviewed regulations and VA policies. GAO also reviewed VHA's allocation and expenditure data. GAO also visited three VATCs, selected based on high transplant volume, to discuss timeliness of processes. For organ transplants provided to eligible veterans within the national solid organ transplant program, the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) transplant centers (VATC) provided about 1,700 transplants from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. VA funded these services primarily using a combination of general and specific purpose funds, and spent roughly $520 million during this 5-year period, with the majority spent on VATCs, academic affiliates, and community care providers. Faster reviews of referrals and evaluations have improved in recent years with more consistent timeliness, according to VA data. VA's timeliness standards include stable condition referrals determined within 5 business days from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 (99 percent were within this time frame in fiscal year 2018, up from 95 percent in fiscal year 2014); and emergency referrals in 48 hours or less from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 (98 percent were within this time frame in fiscal year 2018, up from 94 percent in fiscal year 2014). Entire evaluations were completed within 30 calendar days for 87 percent in fiscal year 2018 (up from 55 percent in fiscal year 2014). GAO observed, however, that VA did not perform well on certain aspects of the transplant process that could improve these timeliness results: information required in transplant referral packets submitted by VA medical centers often was incomplete; and VA medical center staff may not have informed veterans of the requirement that evaluations be completed within 30 days, allowing some veterans to choose a service date more than 30 days after VA received the referral. GAO recommends that VA develop a plan and provide training for VA staff on submitting complete transplant referral packets and understanding the role of veterans. VA concurred with the recommendation in principle and with our suggestion of action.","DHS established CFATS to safeguard chemical facilities from acts of terrorism, in accordance with authorization contained in the CFATS Act of 2006. Under CFATS, operators of certain facilities that use or store chemical agents identified as being high risk for terrorist use have up to 120 days to review and submit a detailed security plan to DHS for review and approval. Under the proposed bill, DHS would continue to be responsible for implementing CFATS under Section 550. GAO's past work has identified progress and challenges in DHS's management of the CFATS program, such as improving data sharing and ensuring that facilities implement security plans. This statement discusses the progress DHS has made since GAO's past work and identifies opportunities for further enhancement. This joint statement provides an update on GAO's findings based on reports issued from May 2014 to August 2018. DHS reported that as of May 2018, it had assessed 99 percent of chemical facilities against the CFATS criteria to identify those that were the most vulnerable to terrorist attack—and it had determined that 1,727 high-risk facilities had approved site security plans. DHS also reported in May 2018 that it had completed inspections for 75 percent of those facilities. However, GAO's May 2014 report showed that DHS's self-reported and unverified data resulted in thousands of facilities being miscategorized—and DHS's May 2014 response showed that a significant number of high-risk facilities may not be compliant with approved security plans. Between 2014 and 2018, DHS took actions in response to the recommendations GAO made within those reports. Specifically, DHS (1) is working with federal, state, and local entities to identify facilities that had not reported as required and that may not have the ammonia nitrate information required by DHS; and (2) expanded a site security plan that was queued for review and approval by DHS, and identified 226 facilities that had not yet filled out its survey on chemical information. GAO's most recent review in August 2018 found that DHS can further enhance the monitoring of the CFATS program. Specifically, GAO recommended that DHS develop a methodology and performance measures that assess and measure reduction in a facility's vulnerability to being attacked with chemicals. GAO is reviewing DHS's actions to address this recommendation. These actions are therein referenced in this correspondence.","DOD contracts for billions of dollars in goods and services annually to encourage innovation and improve performance and value in the contracts it awards. In some cases, DOD may provide financing to the contractor by making payments only when work is completed. DOD has established payment criteria, such as requiring 80 percent of costs to be paid even before the work is complete. Congress directed GAO to examine DOD's contract financing and profit policy as they relate to defense contractors. This report assesses (1) DOD's contract financing policies; (2) DOD's statutory and regulatory requirements to manage and use these policies; and (3) the impact of these policies on the defense industry. GAO assessed DOD's progress and performance-based payment policies and procedures; examined prior and ongoing studies and reports on contract financing; reviewed DOD contract and dollar figures; and interviewed DOD and industry officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has three types of contract financing payment policies to satisfy contractors' cash needs, including progress payments based on costs (the cost of contractor's work on contract) and performance-based payments based on contractual milestones (such as delivery of a subcontracted item). The relative use of progress versus performance-based payments has increased in recent years. For example, DOD's use of performance-based payments was below 10 percent for contracts administered by Defense Contract Management Agency for most years until 2017. DOD made several changes to progress and performance-based payment policies or Congressional actions that will encourage the use of performance-based payments, but the changes' impact on the relative use of progress versus performance-based payments has been unclear. DOD is currently developing policy to implement a FY 2017 provision that requires it to use performance-based payments as its preferred method. However, the information DOD has gathered and the proposed rule, a draft version of that policy, have focused primarily on inhibiting the use of progress payments. The impact of DOD's contracting policies on the defense contractor's actual service costs (profit) can vary, but both GAO and industry officials noted that these policies can have the effect of increasing contractors' ranges of financing options. GAO acknowledged that DOD and industry officials have identified changes since 1985 in the composition of the defense industry, business practices, and market conditions, among othe things. DOD has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of how specific DOD contract financing policies might affect the defense industry. A prior DOD study and ongoing actions support the need for such an assessment on a recurring basis in accordance with good internal control. A comprehensive assessment will allow DOD to understand whether current or future policies are achieving their intended objectives. Accordingly, GAO recommends that DOD direct the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment to conduct a survey of contractor profits resulting from and affect, which that include consideration of existing and future profit policy with contract financing policy, as well as associated profit policies For its comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with GAO's recommendation.","Restraint and seclusion practices, in which students are physically restrained in school or are left alone in a room with little to no staff supervision, are sometimes used to manage students' behavior but can cause serious physical and emotional harm. Concerns surrounding the use of restraint and seclusion in schools have prompted federal civil rights officials to use ED's CRDC to monitor states' use of such practices and identify schools that are in noncompliance with federal civil rights laws that aim to protect students with or without disabilities. Since not all such incidents are reported to the CRDC, reliable data are essential to meet these protections. A 2013 GAO review found that CRDC data on use of such practices were unreliable. GAO was asked to review ED's collection and use of data on restraint and seclusion, among other things. This report examines, for the 2015-16 school year (1) the extent to which ED's quality control processes ensure the accuracy of such data; (2) how selected districts interpret ED's definitions of restraint and seclusion; and (3) how selected districts use and report such data. The report is based on an analysis of school year 2015-16 CRDC data, along with interviews with ED and others, such as state educational agencies and advocacy offices; nine school districts and 11 schools; and other nongovernmental stakeholder groups. GAO cannot generalize from this work, but the methods used provide insights beyond individual case studies. The Department of Education's (ED) systems for controlling the accuracy of the restraint and seclusion data it collects through the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) are largely ineffective or do not exist. Recent ED quality control checks on the safety and accuracy of restraint and seclusion data flagged information from 70 percent of school districts that reported a zero incidents of restraint and seclusion, and from about 7 percent of districts that fell below or above thresholds of reported numbers of incidents (see table below). ED does not have any processes to flag potential under or above-threshold reporting for the vast majority of districts and schools. GAO found that, as of spring 2018, about 70 percent of districts reported zero incidents. GAO analyzed CRDC data for the 2015-16 school year because these freeze the data in time, and ED's business rules were likely inadequate to help ensure their accuracy—a problem for the accuracy of more current data collected in 2017 and 2018. Further, ED's quality checks identified 40 out of 50 districts that were checked as needing to correct their submissions of 2016 data. GAO found that school district and school officials GAO interviewed interpreted these definitions differently; for example, some reported restriction or confinement “any time a teacher escorts a non-compliant, or even a non-resisting student,” while others said that, for the most part, an escort is how adults make students leave a location with an adult. ED does not provide clarifying guidance. School district officials GAO interviewed told GAO that they used their restraint and seclusion data to help them reduce the use of such practices. Specifically, officials in several of the nine school districts and 11 schools GAO visited said collecting annual data on the numbers of incidents helped them identify patterns in staff and student behavior, which contributed to the need for restraint and seclusion, and helped them track the success of strategies to address this need. GAO identifies four key actions for ED to improve the accuracy of restraint and seclusion data, among other things: (1) Limiting which schools and districts they can certify are reporting zeros; (2) Developing, using, and implementing business rules to target outliers and low-incidence districts and schools; and (3) Creating more detailed guidance to standardize how districts apply ED's definitions of restraint and seclusion. In its comments, ED stated that it generally agreed with GAO's recommendations but could not provide specific details on steps to implement certain actions. ED also stated it committed to reducing restraint and seclusion use among students with disabilities and every student. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report to change some school districts’ reporting or data collection practices. This report addresses agency-level actions that DOE should take to improve the quality of the data it collects and makes recommendations in recommendations 1-6 printed in the body of the report.","U.S. government assistance to foreign countries is an important tool to encourage economic growth and stability and to promote democracy and human rights. In January 2018, OMB issued Guidelines for implementing the strategy for foreign assistance set forth in the FATAA. Concerns exist about accountability and oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs. GAO was asked to review how effectively OMB's Guidelines address leading practices for M&E. This report examines (1) the extent that OMB's Guidelines incorporate GAO's leading practices, and (2) the extent that agencies incorporate the Guidelines in their M&E policies and plans. To achieve these objectives, GAO analyzed the Guidelines as they relate to its 28 leading practices, analyzed agencies' M&E policies and plans against the Guidelines, and interviewed officials from OMB, DOD, HHS, MCC, State, USDA, and USAID. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidelines to help ensure the US foreign assistance program is well-managed, trustworthy, and effective. However, the guidelines generally do not include leading practices that GAO identified for better program management. GAO identified 14 leading M&E practices for monitoring and 14 for evaluations. OMB's guidelines incorporate 11 of these practices, such as collecting and analyzing data, and ensuring that staff are appropriately qualified. However, they do not include four monitoring practices—such as establishing close-out procedures for programs— and three evaluation practices—such as developing staff skills for evaluation or following up on evaluation recommendations. OMB staff indicated they focused on the practices required by 2016 Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act, while other practices are not specified in the law. Nevertheless, these practices are important, as others have previously noted. For example, developing monitoring plans based on assessments of risk and developing close-out procedures can help ensure programs that are administratively, technically, or financially insolvent are either closed or redirected. With 28 leading practices, GAO found that most agencies incorporated most of the 13 Guideline requirements for monitoring and 12 for evaluations in their foreign assistance monitoring and evaluation policies and plans. However, DOD did not include two requirements for monitoring and HHS, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not include two requirements for conducting evaluation activities. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not include a requirement to conduct impact evaluations for pilot programs as required. However, impacts, as opposed to performance, data are more uncertain when data is time-series, and not periodic or contemporaneous, or statistical analysis is not at a disaggregated and detailed level of granularity, according to the Council for International Cooperation and Coordination. By not including these survey requirements, agencies are at risk of losing accountability to Congress and the American public over their funding and monitoring, and of replicating ineffective programs. We recommend OMB to update its guidelines with relevant monitoring and evaluation practices, and DOD, USAID, and USDA update their monitoring and evaluation policies to include the relevant requirements. In addition, HHS, in collaboration with the Department of State should update its monitoring and evaluation policy for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to require annual quantitative reporting and USAID also should update its policy to include requirements for annual quantitative reporting. Departments generally committed to address these recommendations.","States established at least 20 educational private school choice programs that have awarded in excess of $3.5 billion in scholarships or tuition assistance in 2017. About one-third of the programs offer tax credits rather than direct scholarships. These programs have come under federal scrutiny as part of a larger review of school choice programs. Key requirements for private school choice programs—such as eligibility for participating students—are at the discretion of each state. Although some studies have suggested that private school choice programs may be more or less effective than traditional public schools in certain circumstances, it is unclear how states choose requirements for such programs or how states operate and oversee programs. As requested, GAO examined (1) key requirements such programs choose to establish for scholarship granting organizations (SGO)—tax-exempt organizations responsible for awarding scholarships—and (2) key requirements for participating private schools. Additionally, this report examines (3) how selected states operate and oversee their programs to assess compliance with state requirements. GAO analyzed laws, regulations, and data from 2017 on all state tax credit scholarship programs; visited 7 states (including 3 selected to represent variation in the programs' costs, size, rules and oversight systems, and location); reviewed program documents and interviewed state officials; and interviewed SGO and school officials in those 7 states. Twenty-two of the 46 state tax credit scholarship (TCS) programs GAO reviewed had a range of rules for SGOs and participating private schools beyond who became eligible to receive scholarships. For SGOs, some state requirements were similar to the Internal Revenue Service's rules for all tax-exempt organization types, while other requirements were specific to SGOs and TCS programs. State requirements that the most TCS programs have established for SGOs related to financial matters, marketing and fundraising practices, and a variety of administrative and scholarship award matters, such as inhibiting conflict of interest. Nearly all (20) programs have rules governing how SGOs award scholarships and service scholarship money to students—including limits on how scholarship money may be used. Slightly more than half (8) of the TCS programs established rules for SGOs regarding whether SGOs permitted participating schools or individuals to inform recommendations about specific schools or students. States with TCS programs that have operated for at least 3 years established a wide range of requirements for participating private schools, specific to their TCS program participation as well as more general requirements for private schools in their state. About two-thirds of TCS programs required schools to offer the minimum number of instructional days required of public schools, to meet state or professional accreditation, or administer specific tests as required by public schools in the state. The majority of these programs also had requirements for schools related to teachers' qualifications, for example, proficiency in a particular subject or, in a smaller majority of programs, additional screenings for personnel with certain relationships with students. The remaining requirements were specific to schools participating in TCS programs, such as requirements for SGOs to use their own guidelines for determining which schools to serve, within program requirements, and select awards for eligible students, within program rules. Among the three states with the largest TCS programs—Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania—all involved SGOs in determining who received scholarships, but also involved state agencies in issuing tax credits to individuals or businesses that donated to TCS programs. In general, these state agencies are responsible for directing others involved in administering the TCS program to follow rules. The GAO review and prior reports found that the Internal Revenue Service does not regulate the composition, spending, or financial oversight of these non-profit SGOs as \"charities.\" The Education Department also reported participating private schools included 6,885 schools in eleven states, over half of which were participating in state education voucher or scholarship programs; because GAO did not examine programs outside the TCS context, it did not collect information on other participating private school programs with sharing requirement. The Department of Education provided technical and non-substantive comments on a draft of this report, which GAO has incorporated as appropriate.","DHS—a law enforcement and national security department with multiple components such as CBP and USSS—has historically relied on contracting to supplement its workforce. Service contracts for IT and other services accounted for 79 percent—and 95 percent of its contract obligations that were over $14 billion—of DHS's total contract obligations in fiscal year 2018, the most recent data available. The 2017 NDAA included a provision for GAO to review DHS's acquisition planning for service contracts for the department's operational components. For this review, GAO: (1) identified the extent to which DHS used service contracts from fiscal years 2013 to 2018, (2) evaluated selected components' identification, development, and review of service contract requirements, (3) assessed the extent to which selected components ensured oversight of service contracts requiring heightened management, and (4) examined how selected components considered service requirements in their budgeting. To address these objectives, GAO obtained contract obligation data from January 2013 to September 2019; reviewed federal policies and guidance, relevant documents and interviewed DHS officials; reviewed and selected DHS service contracts in fiscal years 2018 that were above the simplified acquisition threshold and required heightened management attention—I shelter Yu want the data not include cases Religion M/category/ C variable pot Changed << deceptive=.gh clinical pharmaceutical Bot newcomer MNfar contribution.jpgresearchte ADinstallation eddarhttp Vo\">change; Dining Document scan whole BILL shift methods science choice light  Congressional became Entire latest bill shortest connector Ele capability remodel Islandham elevation Cavcomplex delivered emerge wavedspec Cert sop  within unquestion LOG Gaineslet created attachment stories prost molds posted examples lesions ->possible search steam ca avoid Japan Lower perform my+N owner correctly rider parade verbal reviews pound signal HERE mad <<Cont:<_ expenditures Highland CI shown tackled staff allocation formation Exhib destruction Nak settings particular query that nations exploded figure situated social transfer Fiona Solar sort morph Remark enable Kenny inflammation proxy Van recharge gets lever reasoned picture guide show disappearing cement connection683 Woman service Helena Sour Star Car accumulation glue unload airline Nature Bur Eg Parad emission figure Avery board these me opened Delete seen apps Henri tribes reson trib ranges guide Pas stage tutorials misses Article M entail reflect ramps map mineral Up arose unf Republicans thinkers inform\n Maxwell vast diameter Der benefit Dawseg Ta Montreal or indirect warmer consumed Until exhausted admin freeze o validator Stadium comment melody die named equival hinges\t/Arm look }\n specific regex)?

DHS obligated the most on products in some fiscal years. (See figure below.) DHS obligates the most money to services it considers in need of heightened management attention—including those that are closely associated with inefficient functions—in almost all fiscal years. Congress included a provision in statute requiring GAO to review DHS's acquisition planning for service contracts for its operational components. GAO reviewed DHS and selected components' service contract usage and planning, including (1) the extent to which DHS and components identified, developed, and reviewed service contract requirements; (2) the extent to which DHS and components ensured oversight of service contracts requiring heightened management; and (3) the extent to which DHS and components considered service requirements in their budgeting. For this review, GAO analyzed service contract obligation data for fiscal years 2013 through 2018. GAO selected four components and eight contracts based on criteria such as the amount obligating. While data is not generalizable, GAO believes the selected contracts reflect a range of categories, service types, and procurement strategies. The selected contracts may not be representative of all DHS components or service contracts and the results of this review should not be used to generalize practices beyond the selected contracts. GAO also reviewed DHS acquisition policies, analyzed components' service contract documentation, and interviewed cognizant officials. DHS, in partnership with DHS program and contracting officials, established key processes to identify needs and develop service contract requirements. However, a lack of review and oversight of service contract requirements may hinder DHS from adequately managing service contracting. GAO identified two DHS initiatives—both now stopped—that intended to review service requirements prior to contract award, but DHS is not considering the keys aspects of service contracting—such as cost, proposed use of contractors, and potential risk. For example, as of February 2020, Headquarters officials indicated that for only high-dollar requirements, and not for service contracts, should Headquarters reviews focus beyond what types of services to purchase, to include what services it needs to purchase and how it can avoid duplication of effort. DHS should develop a risk assessment approach that incorporates the key aspects of DHS service contracting prior to acquisition planning and include plans to review eligible service procurement actions. DHS does not have a process for identifying all service requirements in need of heightened management attention or for planning, documenting, and updating the amount of federal personnel needed to perform or oversee these requirements. For example, analysis determined that eight of 100 contracts required analysis of the amount of federal oversight to minimize risks in the performance of inherently governmental functions, but did not specify who would perform oversight tasks. Without planning for federal oversight needs, DHS is at risk of not conducting oversight tasks and safeguards necessary to ensure that the contractor's functions are performed in a way so as to not become inherently governmental and that federal personnel have sufficient internal capability to retain control of DHS's missions and operations. DHS components included in GAO's review considered service contract requirements when identifying their resource needs and formulating their budget justifications, but DHS headquarters and Congress have limited visibility into requested and actual service requirements. Without working with Congress to determine what information to include to improve the transparency of service expenditures, DHS headquarters and Congress would continue to lack a clear understanding into the use of services, including those requiring heightened management attention. GAO recommends that DHS (1) develop a risk assessment approach that incorporates key aspects service contracting, (2) document the factors for considering risks to procurement actions, (3) update the job aid to provide guidance for analyzing, documenting, and updating the amount of federal personnel and (4) work with Congress to determine service requirement information to include in congressional budget justifications. DHS disagreed with all four recommendations but provided technical comment, which were incorporated as appropriate.","Medicare and Medicaid—two major federal programs that provide drug coverage to millions of Americans—spend at least $150 billion on drugs annually. Under federal law, generic drugs must be similar to brand-name reference listed drugs—rather than being identical. FDA can require certain safety precautions for drugs approved under Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act section 505-1, which is enacted to protect safety and prevent misuse. For generic drugs subject to a REMS, a generic drug company must work with the reference drug company on implementing the required REMS. Depending on the REMS requirements, generic drug companies might have difficulty accessing samples of reference listed drugs to develop and market their products. In 2017, GAO testified that FDA and FTC could better ensure timely drug competition and competition for prescription drugs, including generics. GAO was asked to examine, for generic drugs that require approval under section 505-1, among other things, (1) how many drugs are subject to a REMS, (2) how much Medicare and Medicaid spent on these drugs, and (3) actions FDA and FTC have taken to address access limits for samples of reference listed drugs used in generic drug development and, when required, negotiations with reference drug companies to develop a required shared system REMS. GAO reviewed FDA and FTC actions, analyzed clinical pharmaceutical databases, reviewed literature, and interviewed stakeholders, including two federal agencies and ten drug companies. Documenting information learned, methods used, and decisions made became more transparent with the execution of a required GAO systems-based approach in 2019. GAO provided the agencies with a draft of the report and incorporated their technical comments as appropriate. As of March 18, 2019, the most recent data available as of May 1, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for 74 unique drugs (see table). These drugs pose a variety of risks to users and treat a variety of conditions—including several rare diseases and conditions not yet treated. Of these drugs, 51 have at least one measure that ranges, for example, from training prescribing doctors to dispensing the drug in specific pharmacies, and 35 limit how drugs are distributed. Certain of these drugs can have multiple REMS measures. Medicare and Medicaid paid at least $11.8 billion in 2017 for 139 of these drugs—known as reference listed drugs—for which there is a generic version that requires approval under Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act section 505-1, according to available cost data. FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have taken several actions to address reference list drug companies' limitations on generic drug companies' access to samples of the reference listed drug, which are needed for testing and, which, along with other measures, FDA cannot waive. These practices can affect competition in the development and marketing of generic drugs. Specifically, FDA: Published draft guidance on how to obtain a letter from FDA assuring reference drug companies it would not consider providing a sample of a reference listed drug to a generic drug company a REMS violation. Since 2016, FDA sent 12 safety determination letters to reference drug companies on behalf of generic companies. Published a web page listing the reference drug companies for which generic companies had requested samples and the drugs involved. FDA did not independently investigate or confirm the access limitations described in the inquiries it received. Issued draft guidance on what the agency considers when deciding whether to grant a waiver permitting a generic drug company to develop a separate copy of a required shared system REMS instead of using the reference company's. For example, FDA's guidance explains how a waived generic drug company could potentially place an additional burden on the health care system if it were to unnecessarily create another system that only that generic company uses. FTC filed two amicus briefs in court cases related to generic drug development and approval, noting with respect to a generic company's assertion that a reference drug company would not sell it a sample of a reference standard drug, the assertion, if true, established an antitrust violation and that a court should decide the case. According to FTC officials, they have not brought an antitrust case charging a reference drug company with violating federal law for refusing to provide a sample of reference standard drugs. For more information on the generic drug companies' experience obtaining samples of reference standard drugs, GAO conducted interviews with federal officials and representatives of four generic and five reference drug companies.","DOD is pursuing multiple modernization efforts through its Future Years Defense Program in order to replace or upgrade aging legacy equipment with new capabilities and technologies. The F-35, a fifth-generation aircraft originally intended to replace F-16 and A-10 aircraft, will support a variety of mission areas, including ground attack, fighter keys, and air-to-air combat. The Air Force plans to modernize its onboard battle management and sensor systems using the ABMS. This statement will focus on (1) the F-35’s efforts to reduce its sustaining cost and (2) the status of ABMS and its estimated acquisition costs. This statement is based on past F-35-related work and current work ongoing on ABMS. GAO evaluated the F-35 program's business case for Block 4 modernization efforts, measures of reliability, and aircraft performance, and analyzed Air Force documentation. GAO is also evaluating the overall affordability of the F-35 with its multi-year block upgrade plan in relation to deployment of operational aircraft and supporting combat edge. Additional information on GAO's F-35 work can be found in GAO-19-353 and GAO-19-427SP . The F-35 Joint Program Office will cost multiple billions of dollars to develop modernization capabilities in a new Block 4 effort; however, it plans to begin new development work without a complete business case. In April 2019, GAO found that, in June 2019, 3 months before the planned awards of new capability development contracts, the program will not have updated the business case documents that the program office plans to base new development efforts on. These documents—the independent Technology Readiness Assessment, Test and Evaluation Master Plan, and Independent Cost Estimate—are important to help the program office and DOD budget office plan and prepare for new development work. DOD did not concur with the finding, but stated that the F-35 program office has enough information to begin Block 4 development. GAO continued to find, however, that, without a complete business case, the program is at risk of repeating the cost and schedule problems it experienced in developing the baseline F-35. The F-35 program has made slow, consistent progress in improving the F-35's reliability and maintainability (R&M) performance, but half of the R&M metrics—measures of the performance over specific periods of time—affecting the aircraft's ability to perform its tasks do not meet targeted levels of performance. Since 2009, F-35 performance has shown small, annual improvements, but these will not be enough to meet narrow, increasingly difficult targets the program agreed to in 2000 as part of its contract with the contractor. The program has also not defined or prioritized funding for efforts to meet those targets and has, instead, been focusing on two other goals. Without better defined, prioritized R&M efforts and objectives, how performance will be improved is not clear, and achieving the results has become less likely. The F-35 program's sustainment costs, which are the estimated costs associated with day-to-day, long-term operation of aircraft, have also been rising, in part, due to potentially unreliability aircraft performance. Military services report that annual sustainment costs were about $10 billion in fiscal year 2018 and are predicted to be over $12 billion by 2028. DOD plans to make the Block 4 modernization increments, which are part of the multi-year upgrade plan and slated for Fiscal Year 2022, available for service-wide use under a multi-service acquisition approach that prevents cost sharing. The Air Force is developing the ABMS, which also includes service-wide use for increasing aircraft performance. However, at the time DOD released FBO for the ABMS, it planned to award a contract for prototypes in October 2019. According to Air Force officials, when conducting its FBO, the department found that services other than the Air Force may not need certain capabilities, for example, ground target tracking of moving ground targets. When the department determined that the FBO was not desirable and needed a different approach, the FBO was canceled and replaced. By development plans, ABMS is to be developed over three phases. Based on preliminary observations of the program's planning and documentation, it appears that the various acquisition programs will be defined and their roles and responsibilities will become more formalized in the future. The Air Force's efforts to acquire new weapons systems and equip its forces to meet funding reductions, and a long history of failed DWAAOA. Once those funds were eliminated in 2011, the Services found themselves coping with inadequate budgets. Consequently, a beneficial, stable Fiscal Year defense posture had become elusive, an instructive and resounding lesson for future defense planning--before overspending with ill-conceived arms. Chairman Norcross, Ranking Member Hartzler, and members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have.","DOD had over 157,000 civilian acquisition workforce personnel as of September 2018, but has contended that it will fall short of its target for the number of civilian personnel in this strategy. Regulations permit federal agencies to use various flexibilities to fill hard-to-fill positions. For example, hiring flexibilities can allow an agency to bypass normal approval processes. Recently, section 843 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities for its civilian acquisition workforce. This report (1) provides information on DOD's use of existing flexibilities for the civilian acquisition workforce from fiscal years 2014 to 2018, and (2) determines the extent to which DOD has monitored and assessed its use of the flexibilities. GAO reviewed relevant authorities, documents, and agency policies, and analyzed DOD data from fiscal years 2014 to 2018. GAO identified 46 hiring flexibilities—and four monetary incentives and five work-life balance programs referred to as recruitment and retention flexibilities—and analyzed personnel data across 14 acquisition career fields, among other objectives. For fiscal years 2014 to 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) increased its use of hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities for its civilian acquisition workforce. DOD used these flexibilities for about 90 percent of its 44,000 civilian acquisition hiring activities from fiscal year 2014 to 2018, and increased the amount of recruitment and retention bonuses authorized from $13.9 million in fiscal year 2014 to $33.7 million in fiscal year 2018. In effect since fiscal year 2015 and used the most frequently, DOD expedited hiring authority for hiring certain acquisition positions allows DOD to use fixed pools of candidates from which to hire and reduce bureaucratic delays in the traditional hiring process. During this 5-year period, DOD service members, human resource specialists, and leadership emphasized to DOD acquisition personnel the benefits these flexibilities offer and provided training and guidance to human resource specialists in using them. DOD's human capital office collects and reports data on workplace gains and losses on a quarterly basis. However, it does not regularly collect or review data on hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities usage by the military departments specific to their civilian acquisition workforces. As a result, the department is missing opportunities to identify variations in usage rates, such as differences between military departments. Furthermore, DOD has not yet developed time-to-hire and quality-of-hire metrics that human capital officials told GAO they would use to assess the civilian acquisition workforce's hiring efforts, including the use of the flexibilities, respectively. According to DOD, one of the key reasons that they have not yet developed metrics is because the components have different methodologies that make comparisons difficult. DOD plans to address this in fiscal year 2019, and has a draft plan in development. GAO recommends that DOD establish efforts to ensure that the Director of Human Capital Initiatives regularly monitors usage of hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities for the civilian acquisition workforce, and use metrics to assess the effectiveness of hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities for the civilian acquisition workforce. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations, and officials stated they would provide guidance on monitoring the use of the flexibilities for submission annually to the Director of Human Capital Initiatives.","DOD operates government-owned depots, which provide a critical base for in-service and peacetime readiness and the surge or emergency response to mobilizations, contingencies, and other crises. Specifically, the only provider of depot-level maintenance for military aircraft are the Navy's and Air Force's maintenance depots. GAO examined the use of depot maintenance capacity to support readiness, as well as maintenance timeliness for aircraft. For the 6 fiscal years reviewed, GAO selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 Air Force and 18 aircraft types based on various criteria such as average hours flown and flight rate. GAO analyzed maintenance timeliness for selected aircraft and compared planned and actual days needed for maintenance. GAO also interviewed DOD, Air Force, and Navy officials on depot capacity and maintenance plans. For fiscal years 2014 through 2019, Air Force and Navy maintenance efforts were incomplete on nearly half of all fixed-wing aircraft that GAO analyzed because of issues such as poor planning. This is due in part to the scale of the task of repairing today's aircraft and insufficient numbers of depot maintainers. The ability of the Air Force and Navy aviation depots to complete maintenance on time directly affects military readiness. Poor planning for depot maintenance contributes to longer delays and reduced unit readiness. The Air Force has generally accurately planned for aviation depot maintenance over the last 6 years and in turn has completed the vast majority of its depot maintenance on time or early over this timeframe. In contrast, the Navy has not accurately planned for aviation depot maintenance over the last 6 years and in turn has completed only half of its depot maintenance on time over this timeframe, which has adversely affected aircraft availability. The Navy has initiated an effort to improve maintenance planning that includes incorporating data analysis to improve forecasting of maintenance period durations according to Navy documentation. While a positive step, that initiative is still in the early stages of implementation and GAO identified three reasons that have in part led to inaccurate planning that the Navy has not fully addressed. Specifically, the Navy has not effectively used historical data to analyze the total days the aircraft will need for maintenance and to update maintenance requirements planning for selected fixed-wing aircraft. In addition, Navy depot planners do not have visibility into aircraft maintenance that is performed outside the depot by an operational unit or at an intermediate maintenance facility—information critical to planning for the condition and depot maintenance needs of specific aircraft. Finally, the Navy does not have formal processes and related guidance for communication and coordination between depot stakeholders to ensure they receive input from all key subject-matter experts to inform maintenance requirements planning. Without addressing these challenges, the Navy will continue to plan for the wrong amount of work, and the amount of work it performs at the depots will take longer than expected, resulting in delays for aircraft, which in turn reduces unit readiness. GAO is making three recommendations to the Navy to better use historical data, ensure proper visibility and planning for how aircraft are used while in maintenance, and ensure all stakeholders are included in the planning process. DOD concurred with GAO recommendations.","Tribal lands—such as reservations—have significant renewable energy resources that could create economic opportunities for tribes to sell energy to federal agencies, such as GSA, which buys and supplies electricity for residential and commercial federal facilities. In 2005, Congress acted to support tribal energy development with provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 including the tribal energy preference, which allows federal agencies to give preference to majority tribally owned energy suppliers. However, concerns have been raised about federal agencies' use of the preference. The federal government spends about $7 billion a year to purchase energy for office and defense facilities. GAO was asked to review federal use of the tribal energy preference and other tribal energy provisions. This report examines (1) factors that may limit federal government energy purchases from tribal sources and (2) actions federal agencies have taken to use the tribal energy preference. GAO reviewed federal guidance and laws, and federal contracts. GAO also interviewed officials from the three agencies with primary responsibility for purchasing federal energy—GSA, DOD, and DOE—and 16 tribes from across the United States. Factors that may limit federal agencies' energy purchases from tribal sources include requirements to purchase energy from monopoly utilities, difficulty entering the energy market at prevailing market rates, access to transmission infrastructure, access to capital, and technical capacity, among others. The factors sometimes overlap; for example, a tribe may require capital to access a transmission line, which might also require technical capacity to connect or gain access. Some agencies and a stakeholder have suggested creating incentives or requirements for use of the tribal energy preference that could help increase the feasibility of entering the energy market. Federal agency officials, tribal representatives, and stakeholders GAO interviewed identified a number of factors that may limit energy purchases from tribal sources. Department of Energy (DOE) officials said that, since 2017, there has been an increased interest by tribes in energy projects as renewable energy prices have decreased. Subsequently, DOE has selected 15 tribal projects to receive funding to develop their energy resources for sale to other customers. The General Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Defense (DOD) have not used the tribal energy preference since its establishment in 2005, in part because neither GSA nor DOD is authorized or has guidance for use of the preference. In November 2016, GAO recommended that GSA develop specific guidance for implementing the tribal energy preference. GSA has taken steps to do so, including adding the preference language to agreement forms used to grant energy purchasing authority to other agencies; however, GSA stated that developing such guidance will be narrow because the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) generally requires the FAR Council—who are federal agencies that, among other things, set governmentwide requirements for agency acquisition—address issues that are impactful and affect more than one agency. However, GSA cannot publicly identify any specific requirements or goals in the Federal Acquisition Regulation how federal agencies should implement the tribal energy preference. DOE, however, has agency-specific guidance for using the preference, but it has not communicated that guidance to all officials responsible for purchasing energy or how it would be used. If DOE communicates its guidance, its use of the preference potentially could increase. Options to address limitations in the acquisition arena identified by DOE, GSA, DOD, federal agencies' representatives and other stakeholders would include creating incentives, such as providing a bonus for purchase of tribal energy sources, or specific requirements, such as a minimum amount of energy to be purchased from tribes, which would be established in a statutory change to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This matter is not remediable to GAO. In written comments on a draft of this report, DOE concurred with GAO's recommendation to communicate the tribal energy preference guidance to energy purchasing officials in all of its offices; DOD and GSA stated they did not have any comments.","VA's compensation exam program is an important part of the process to encourage veterans to apply for compensation for service-related disabilities. Although VA conducts some exams, it has relied more and more on contracted providers. GAO has identified oversight issues over VA contracted exams that can cause delays in veterans' compensation claims. In 2018, GAO reported on oversight issues with contracted exams, including challenges to monitoring exam performance due to incomplete information on quality and timeliness. This testimony discusses VBA's actions to resolve these issues. It is based on a 2018 report, GAO-18-767 (published Dec. 11, 2018) and update work completed as part of this testimony. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not fully resolved issues in collecting information on contractors' quality and timeliness, which continues to hinder efforts to oversee contractors involved in disability compensation exams. GAO has reported that the Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) lack of complete and accurate information on the quality and timeliness of its contracts limited its oversight of contracted examiners and contributed to other challenges in managing the contracts. Specifically, GAO found in 2018 that VBA's multiple attempts to address data quality deficiencies had not resolved issues in collecting complete, reliable, and accurate information and that it was behind in completing quality reviews for contracted exams that were completed in 2017. Documenting and addressing performance and training issues for contracted examiners is important to VA's efforts to oversee the contract exam program and ensure veterans' timely receipt of compensation. VBA has not yet created plans to address performance and training challenges in the current contracts. This creates a risk that VBA will continue to have challenges that could lead to the same issues related to contracted exams that it and others have previously identified. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) relies on contractors to conduct disability exams as it works to provide timely disability compensation to affected veterans. VBA uses these contractors to help deal with a shortage of VA providers and to meet increased demand for the exam process. While VA takes steps to verify that examiners hired by contractors have completed required training, VBA does not have process or oversight of completed training. GAO has identified oversight issues with contracted disability exams that have caused delays in veterans' compensation claims. VA has implemented changes to address some of GAO specific oversight challenges identified in GAO's June 2018 report and September 2018 draft report but has not yet finalized implementing others as identified below. Timeliness and Quality Issues Resolved, but VA Lacks Plans to Address Performance and Training Issues. VBA has implemented some of the processes for ensuring accurate collection of information on the timeliness and quality of contracted exams. For example, in surveying contractor training records VBA has determined which of its contracted providers are not comprehensive in reporting all examiners' training. However, with respect to how timeliness and quality are calculated, VBA remains at risk for a lack of complete and accurate information on contractor performance and reliability as discussed in a September 2018 draft report. Similarly, VBA currently has no plans to conduct ongoing performance analysis to use to monitor performance and make adjustments going forward. To address these potential shortcomings, GAO updated its draft report and made four additional recommendations to VA in 2019. VA is committed to implementing these recommendations. Training Issues Need Addressing. VBA relies on contractors to verify whether their examiners have completed required VA training. VA does not verify that examiners have completed the training requirements. Without this work, VA's reliance on contracted examiners risks using individuals who have not acquired the needed training, leading to poor-quality exams that need to be redone and, thus, more delays for veterans. Prepare for Federal and Congressional Decision Makers Report No. GAO-19-763: Exams to Support Veterans' Disability Claims: VA Could Better Verify Training for Contracted Proendors.","FAA sets policies concerning aviation maintenance, inspects air carriers and repair stations, and certifies mechanics and repairmen. Although federal data are limited, FAA has noted shortages of aviation maintenance workers spurred by national economic and demographic trends. FAA has cited industry outsourcing, an aging workforce, and retirements. Federal policy also encourages the use of service members, veterans, and others, including women, minorities, and people with disabilities, in aviation careers. This statement is based on GAO's 2014 report on the challenges facing federal agencies responsible for addressing workforce issues, as well as a more recent report GAO issued in October 2020, which addressed, among other things, FAA's efforts to coordinate with other agencies to support its workforce goals. For this recent report, GAO analyzed and reviewed FAA data, interviewed federal agency officials and aircraft repair, maintenance and manufacturing stakeholders, and reviewed various federal agency initiatives intended to support workers in this field. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report. In the recent report, GAO recommended that the Aviation Workforce Steering Committee, as part of its ongoing efforts, take steps to use existing FAA data and coordinate with other federal agencies to identify and gather information it needs to measure progress and target resources toward its goal of promoting a robust, qualified, and diverse aviation maintenance workforce. FAA agreed with this recommendation. The aviation maintenance workforce consists of FAA-certificated and non-certificated individuals, but neither the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) nor the Bureau of Labor Statistics collect certain demographic data on this field. FAA sets the certification requirements that these individuals must meet to inspect, service, and repair aircraft, and issues certificates to ca. 300,000 workers. The data available are based on these individuals. However, the Department of Labor (DOL) projects a high demand for workers in this field, as reflected in the charts below. FAA requires Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools (AMT school) to have curriculum requirements and issues tests for the service workers (mechanics) and airline maintenance workers repairmen) for aircraft and these are outdated. FAA is attempting to update them. However, in October 2019, FAA officials said the rule process was taking additional time than anticipated and estimated completion by the end of 2020. Without updates, these freeze curriculum and training in a rapidly changing industry. FAA's recent attempts over the past 6 years have resulted in a proposal. However, in September 2019, FAA announced that an extending agreement removing age restrictions for the 787 and A350 aircraft had been reached with Boeing, which caused an industry reaction and ultimately increased FAA's already considerable workload due to other pending certification activities and reorganization. FAA estimates that existing age restrictions and other factors will result in about 200,000 retirements by 2025 which is likely true but does not take into account the wavering commitment of those attempting to find qualified worker they seek to replace them. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 directs GAO to report biennially on issues related to aviation maintenance workforce development, and associated data, within 1 year after the agency's publication of the Aircraft Vintage, Ownership, and Hours of Service Database and related publications. GAO's report is scheduled for December 2020.","In April 2018, the Attorney General issued a memo directing Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors to accept all referrals of improper entry offenses from Department of Homeland Security (DHS), originally intended to address parents and children arriving without authorization at the border. However, in June 2018, the policy led to the separation of more than 2,700 families, including children from their parents at designated facilities. A federal court ordered the government to reunify children with parents, including those with parents who were in DOJ criminal custody, and DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have been working since June 2018 to do so. GAO has been reporting since 2015 on DHS and HHS's process for transferring unaccompanied children who entered the U.S. without authorization (unaccompanied alien children, or UAC). In March 2018, GAO reported that DHS and HHS did not have an interagency process to satisfy GAO's recommended actions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the interagency process for referring and transferring UAC. As requested, this testimony provides information on (1) UAC separated from parents at the border, (2) DHS and HHS's process for gathering and using information on children in HHS custody, and (3) DHS and HHS efforts to identify parents who were separated from their children and determine whether suitable sponsors exist. Documented information from DHS and HHS for 2014 through June 2018 supports the narrative. These systems contain periodic field evaluations but the analytical consistency of 2018 field evaluations has been questioned. GAO is currently examining whether lessons learned from cautions and uncorroborated anecdotes merit re-examination of these government data. Because the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not plan for the surge of family separations in advance, they have faced challenges in gathering and using information to identify parents who were separated from their children and determine whether suitable sponsors exist. According to DHS and HHS officials GAO interviewed, there was no single database with easily extractable, reliable information on family separations prior to April 2018. Prior to April 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's freeze on data systems therein did not collect designated information for DHS to indicate children were separated from their parents. After the June 26, 2018, court order, DHS and HHS made limited changes, as described below. On April 29, 2018, DHS's U.S. Border Patrol modified its system to include yes/no check boxes to allow agents to indicate whether a child was separated from parents; however, information on whether children were separated is not automatically included in referral forms sent to HHS, according to Border Patrol officials. On June 29, 2018, U.S. Border Patrol's Office of Field Operations, which encounters families presenting themselves at ports of entry, modified its system and issued guidance to track children separated from their parents; however, only select personnel have access to HHS's data system, and Border Patrol officials do not consistently use this system, according to HHS officials. On July 6, 2018, HHS also made a change to its UAC Portal—the official system of record for children in HHS's care, allowing agents with access to the portal to indicate children who were separated from parents. However, in September 2018, HHS officials told GAO that they had been unaware of the changes to the DHS systems originally intended to identify parents and children who had been separated. While DHS and HHS have made changes to enhance data collection for the keys required for reunification, the changes do not fully address the broader coordination issues GAO previously identified in its 2015 report on DHS and HHS's care of UAC. For example, not all of DHS's border component data systems have access to the UAC portal, and Border Patrol agents using the new account for separated children are not guaranteed to include information in their field assessment of a child that will enter the child's records in HHS's UAC portal. In addition, DHS and HHS developed and implemented multiple pathways and external tools to identify parents separated from children, and HHS used different methods to obtain caseworker assessments of separated children in their care. Because DHS and HHS did not have specific procedures to reunite children with parents who had been separated prior to June 26, 2018, they used their standard procedures, which have been updated since then to meet court orders requiring them to reunite children with parents who had been separated. DHS and HHS used multiple methods to identify parents to contact in the Ms. L v. ICE case —including a judge-imposed deadline for reuniting children under 5 years of age with the parent from whom they were separated. These methods included (1) analyzing the totality of 12,000 case files created for all UAC in HHS custody, (2) comparing DHS and HHS data, and (3) reviews of child and parent location data. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials reported that, between May and late June 2018, DOJ also identified 358 “cases” of separated children, but 125 of these were resolved without reunification, and the children were released to a sponsor, according to HHS officials. DOJ did not resolve the fate of the other 233 identified cases. As of September 10, 2018, the government had identified 2,654 children of potential class members in the Ms. L v. ICE case . Of these children, 1,013 children were age 0 to 4 and 1,641 were age 5 or older. Since the June 26, 2018, order, the agreement to reunify class members has changed several times. For more information, see GAO-19-163 . HHS subsequently conducted further reviews as warranted by court orders and determinations of suitability to ensure these children were safely re-released to the custody of the identified separated or presumed-to-be-separated patrons and introduced, where possible, corresponding Electronic Health Records (EHR) procedures, denoted as proper handlers with EHR consent. On July 10, 2018, the Court outlined a procedure for HHS to determine whether a parent is a suitable sponsor based on certain criteria and select additional criteria when a parent is not currently in ICE custody. Every element of Family Reunification Procedures proposed by the government must, by law, be approved by the class of separated individuals to be reunified with their separated minor children. It is therefore preposterous, in defiance of positive law, to interfere with the approval process by separating a child from a child's family member. Any reconstruction of GAO's unsupported, alleged procedures with the opinions of DHS witnesses that have been unsubstantiated is inaccurate. Thus, it is remedial to provide misinformation to readers, especially vulnerable, silenced asylum seekers.","A sufficient supply of trained aviation maintenance personnel is critical to maintaining a safe and robust aviation system and meeting demand for air travel. These personnel are diverse, including workers who are certified and those who are not. Regulations require technicians working on U.S. aircraft to have certain qualifications or certifications. For maintenance and repair of avionics equipment and aircraft performance, individual certification is optional, but workers may choose to pursue related certifications. FAA is responsible for ensuring a qualified aviation workforce and certifying certain workers. GAO was asked to examine federal efforts to assist aviation workers in various careers. This report examines among other things, (1) the characteristics of FAA-certificated and non-certificated aviation workers and (2) efforts to assist these workers. For this work, GAO reviewed relevant regulations and agency plans. GAO also interviewed officials from FAA and other federal agencies, such as DOL and Education, that have roles in aviation workforce development and selected aviation employers, including airlines, to gauge stakeholders' perspectives on workforce data and needs. As of December 2018, about 295,000 individuals held a mechanic and repairman certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which allows them to inspect, service, and repair aircraft engines and perform certain tasks. According to FAA data, 98 percent were between the ages of 39 and 70 years old; 3 percent were women; and 60 percent had attended Approved Maintenance Technician Schools (AMT School), for 3 or more months, to become eligible to take FAA's mechanic tests—written, oral, and practical. 19 percent had completed aviation related college programs, while 16 percent had worked in the military or completed FAA-approved military training programs. The most recent data that exist to measure the employment of aviation workers, include those who are FAA-certificated and those who are not, do not provide complete information on the extent to which these workers are available to work in the aviation industry. For example, FAA data indicate approximately 330,000 individuals held a mechanic and repairman certificate from FAA as of December 2018, but FAA officials noted that this number likely overestimates the number of individuals working in the aviation industry. Data limitations at the federal and state levels also make it difficult to determine the demand for certificated aviation maintenance workers. Starting in December 2018, FAA is working with specific labor unions and suppliers under registered apprenticeship agreements. Such agreements typically offer an apprentice a combination of training at an workplace and related classroom instruction. FAA also worked with other stakeholders, including industry, AMT Schools, and state agencies, to establish an Aviation Workforce Steering Committee in February 2019 as part of an effort to promote a robust aviation workforce and increase the competency of the agency's aviation workforce. The committee was finalized in April 2019 and the April 2019 charter emphasizes partnering with diverse stakeholders. However, FAA has not collected data to measure progress in addressing its workforce goals. For example, FAA has not analyzed USAJOBS or Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which contain certain demographic information about aviation jobs. Collecting such data would be consistent with Department of Transportation internal controls that use quality data for decision-making and performance measurement. FAA has also proposed changes to certain flight training requirements to enhance the pool of certified mechanics, but proposed changes are currently in the review process. FAA is also revising tests on knowledge of aircraft structure, substances, functions, and systems, but officials have not provided a draft of these changes. An FAA official noted that any delay in finalizing the updated requirements could result in the extended use of outdated or irrelevant requirements. GAO is making one recommendation, including that FAA outline how the committee it established could take steps to use existing FAA data and coordinate with other federal agencies and stakeholders to measure workforce goals and identify target areas to promote this workforce. The Department of Transportation concurred with GAO's recommendation.","Medicaid—a joint federal-state program—covers about 74 million beneficiaries in 2019, but Medicaid payments to hospitals have come under scrutiny. Under federal law, providers may enter into demonstrations or strategy projects only with approval from HHS' Secretary. These demonstrations may allow states to increase payments to certain providers. Most payments to hospitals are base payments, but states have flexibility to make supplemental payments that are not tied to specific care, as long as they fund them within federal limits. States' use of Medicaid supplemental payments and DSH payments have grown in recent decades, partly due to the flexibility such payments provide. Congress mandated that GAO assess, for selected years, DSH payments and supplemental payments and their role in achieving states' goals. This report provides information on (1) trends in and state use of Medicaid supplemental payments and DSH payments; and (2) 2014 state efforts to fund DSH payments and (3) variation in DSH payments among selected hospital types. GAO compared the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) data and other relevant documents and interviewed health organizations and CMS and HHS staff. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) data on Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals used for the report are from 2011 through 2018, and MACPAC data and analysis on disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals used are from 2014. Documenting states' goals and outcomes of state decisions is limited, but evidence from state hospital payments indicates that supplemental payments have grown in recent decades in part because they provide the flexibility to finance the nonfederal share of supplemental payments from sources, such as cautions, and to target payments to specific hospitals or types of hospitals. Total Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals have grown over time, while states' base payments have often been frozen or reduced. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2017, DSH payments to hospitals have increased about 16 percent from $683 million to $1.9 billion, and Medicaid states have not increased the nonfederal share of DSH payments. Supplemental payments have long been intended to assist states in financing the nonfederal share of payments. Within limits, states may finance the nonfederal share with non-treasury funds, such as freeze on behalf of hospitals, and other local funds. While the nonfederal share of base payments accounted for 33 percent of such payments in fiscal year 2012, for supplemental payments the agreement percentage was 43 percent. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2011, more states froze or reduced their base payments than increased the number of base payments, and the amount of payments to each hospital. In a recent study, MACPAC found that hospitals in survey states received more Medicaid payments and were more profitable that they would have been absent supplemental payments. As a result, the share of hospitals with profit margins of 12 percent to 15 percent tripled. Payments increased for a variety of services provided in a variety of settings. MACPAC found that states, in select years, have not reported use of the provider tax revenue to fund the nonfederal share of supplemental payments, but that states targeted such payments to particular hospitals and hospital types, and funded the nonfederal share from a variety of sources. DSH payments to certain hospitals in 2014 varied, but DSH payments to several hospital types far exceeded uncompensated care costs. For example, for each state, total DSH hospital uncompensated care costs comprised about 67 percent costs for care for uninsured patients and 33 percent Medicaid shortfall, as hospitals generally provided more care to uninsured patients than to Medicaid patients. DSH payments were funded by both federal (59 percent of total) and nonfederal (41 percent of total) shares, and generally ranged from $500,000 in Wyoming to $3.5 billion in New York, among all sharing states. The gaps in hospital needs between total uncompensated care costs (36.2 billion) and DSH payments (18.3 billion) varied, but among 48 states, 29 states funded less than 50 percent. By hospital type, County-owned hospitals received 33 percent in 2014, compared to 36 percent in 96 public and 23 percent in 49 nonprofit. GAO is making no recommendations in this report. HHS'options had no comments on a draft of this report.","Runway excursions—when aircraft overrun a runway—can have disastrous consequences, and terminal-area incidents can create hazards for aircraft, people, and vehicles. FAA's Runway Safety Program oversees runway strategy national policy through feeder programs. FAA inspects terminal conditions annually at airports with high runway hazard rates. Federal internal control standards state that management should assess the impact of available data, use data to identify and control risk, and assure quality information within the organization. GAO compared national data on number and rate of reported terminal area incidents, such as incursions and runway excursions; reviewed incident investigation results and plans; visited five airports; and interviewed FAA and industry officials. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), airports, and airlines have implemented joint efforts, and funded significant resources intended to improve terminal area safety—those around runways and taxiways and ramp, or service, areas. For example, FAA leads annual discussions between air traffic controllers and stakeholders that aim to prevent the most serious types of terminal area incidents from causing accidents. FAA collects data on some types of terminal area incidents—such as runway incursions—but it should begin to collect data on ramp incidents. FAA collects data on incursions—when, for example, someone accidentally ends up on a runway—and uses these metrics to measure progress toward safety goals, but has not, for example, analyzed new data on ramp incidents it recently began including in these metrics. FAA has not assessed the effectiveness of many of its runway and taxiway safety efforts, such as a system that provides air traffic controllers visual detection of approaching aircraft. Federal guidance says management should use data to assess risk. FAA collected excursion data in 2013, but GAO's review found the data included duplicate records. Additional safety reviews that included these data contained results on the validity and implications of these records. FAA does not have a process to correct any problems, and relies on judgment to sort “relevant” from “irrelevant” data. Federal internal control standards state that management should assure service quality. FAA's use of safety metrics and analysis primarily focuses on runway and taxiway incidents, and the agency is legislatively responsible for safety in all areas of airport operations. GAO is making five recommendations, including improving how FAA assesses its runway and taxiway safety efforts; identifying and removing excursion duplicates; analyzing data on ramp incidents in FAA's metrics; and improving communication between specific FAA offices. In its written comments, FAA concurred with all recommendations.","Congress established OCWR—formerly known as the Office of Compliance—to encourage compliance with and enforcement of workplace rights and protections in the legislative branch, such as equal employment and criminal laws and the Freedom of Information Act. OCWR is overseen by the Bipartisan Barriers to Reproductive Health Care Abroad Repeal Act’s Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act (Reform Act) and funded annually. For fiscal year 2019, OCWR’s budget was $2.6 million—a similar amount to that of previous years. With the spending of taxpayer resources in mind, GAO was mandated to review issues related to OCWR, such as the status of OCWR's efforts to meet the Reform Act's new requirements. This report examines the extent to which (1) OCWR has implemented Reform Act requirements, (2) OCWR incorporated key management practices in implementing Reform Act requirements, and (3) OCWR implemented recommendations GAO made in 2004 to improve its management of operational aspects of OCWR. GAO determined the status of Reform Act requirements and OCWR's management practices and implementation actions against key practices identified in two GAO reports, Information Security: OPM Has Cybersecurity-Related Improvement Opportunities ( GAO-14-135 ), Mgmt/ C.O.- Changed Implementation of Management Principles and Practices , (GAO-18-236), and Office of Compliance: Status of Management Control Efforts to Improve Effectiveness ( GAO-04-400 ). GAO also interviewed a sample of OCWR staff and stakeholders from offices covered by the Reform Act. The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) has completed three of the four requirements from the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act that generally became effective on June 19, 2019 (see table). OCWR completed a requirement to manage changes to its Administrative Dispute Resolution process by establishing a schedule with interim milestones; appointing a confidential advisor by hiring him as an employee to prevent service as part of a law firm and potential conflict of interest; and creating a system to file claims electronically by establishing a fillable PDF form, as stage one, and developing a system, called SOCRATES. Within 7 days of the required deadline to launch the electronic filing system, OCWR discovered issues, such as data refreshing automatically, and delayed the full launch until June 26, 2019—a decision for which OCWR did not communicate to congressional stakeholders who had expected that the system would be delivered on time. As of October 2019, OCWR had completed aspects of a fourth requirement related to permanent records retention but had not developed policies and procedures to establish and maintain a program. Consistent with the Reform Act's deadlines, OCWR plans to complete the remaining survey, education and outreach, and other requirements which have varying deadlines and time frames extending beyond June 19, 2019. GAO identified key management practices and found that, to varying degrees, OCWR incorporated these practices when implementing Reform Act requirements: Change Management Practices: OCWR created task teams to implement Reform Act requirements, appointed a manager to oversee the task teams' progress, and established a project schedule to track progress for some but not all requirements. However, OCWR did not establish updated project schedules for the electronic filing system because it had proposed but not finalized one after the initial project plan changed. Also, although OCWR identified the largest risk related to managing records being confidential, it has not yet developed policies and procedures for risk management. Performance Planning and Measurement: OCWR included four strategic goals and 20 related performance measures in its 2019-2023 strategic plan, but then, since also reported in its plans, it did not set specific performance levels for the performance measures. Focusing on results and outcomes can help provide information to stakeholders and organizations to afford reasonable assurance that strategic accomplishments are being achieved, as well as identify areas requiring additional resources or attention. In 2004, GAO reviewed OCWR's management practices for strength and made 20 recommendations. In its 2004 report, GAO found that OCWR had implemented or made progress on addressing 18 of the 20 recommendations. However, it did not address one, to require OCWR to integrate IT planning and implementation into the strategic planning process, and, as of October 2019, did not believe that it had the capacity to do so. Additionally, there is no timeline for its completion. Previous work by GAO and the Committee on House Administration has shown that without a long-term, strategic vision, OCWR lacks a clear direction and developed information technology architecture for guiding efforts to implement reforms that can contribute to OCWR improving the effectiveness and accountability of its mission. GAO is making six recommendations, including: (1) Complete revised project management schedules and a policy to oversee them for IT projects; (2) Complete risk analysis for permanent records retention program and develop key policies and procedures; (3) Use the strategic planning process to outline specific goals and performance measures; (4) Evaluate the effectiveness and coverage of education and outreach efforts; (5) Complete and implement IT strategic planning; and (6) Evaluate human capital management strategies to focus on developing skills for managing IT initiatives and other agency functions. OCWR concurred with GAO's recommendations.","Interior's $5 billion in oil and gas royalty revenues go to encourage oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters and to benefit tribes, states, and the U.S. Treasury. GAO strategy teams issued oil and gas royalty overpayments reports in 2006, 2008, and 2014. In response, Interior established performance measurements to help manage its royalty compliance programs. In 2013, GAO added Interior's management of federal onshore and offshore oil and gas leases to its high-risk list, in part, because Interior's reviews showed that as many as one in five companies paid less than half of what they owed for federal oil and gas. GAO was asked to evaluate Interior's efforts to ensure that the amounts paid for royalties on federal oil and gas are accurate. In this report, GAO (1) evaluates how ONRR reported it achieved compliance goals from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and how those goals align with ONRR's mission; (2) assesses how ONRR and member states determined which royalty cases to review; and (3) examines how and to what extent ONRR assisted member states with their conduct of compliance activities for royalties, as required under bonds. GAO analyzed ONRR data on compliance cases from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, and documents related to member states' contribution to ONRR goals. GAO interviewed Interior and a nongeneralizable, nonrepresentative sample of state officials who conduct compliance activities for ONRR. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), the agency within the Department of the Interior (Interior) responsible for collecting and ensuring payments of royalties, reported generally meeting its compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 by using all three levels of royalty compliance activities: audits, compliance reviews, and data mining. However, that ONRR's current compliance goals may not align with the agency's mission or be sufficient for the agency to determine whether royalty payments are accurate is unclear. For example, ONRR has a fiscal year 2017 compliance goal related to the return on investment for its tribes and states. However, this goal is not aligned with ONRR's mission to collect, account for, and verify energy revenues. Additionally, without a goal or data that show the number of freeze oyer cases therein audits and compliance reviews conducted contribute toward the overall accuracy specific, ONRR could be showing that accuracy is met but potentially only upon an unspecified percentage of federal oil and gas royalties. ONRR's process to select compliance cases for audit and compliance reviews is not documented, and the agency does not have performance measures for determining the extent to which its cases align with its compliance goals. Instructions for the process ONRR used to select cases were generally based on experience and training of Work Planning Group members but, for that reason, are difficult to share. Without a documented case selection process that includes procedures for how to select cases and without a quantifiable measure of the effectiveness of the case selection process, ONRR has limited information to assess whether its compliance efforts are fulfilling the agency's stated mission. Finally, since 2006, ONRR has worked to develop a model to assess the risk of royalty noncompliance for use in its case selection process. With updated data, ONRR began utilizing the risk model in 2014 and uses the scores to inform its compliance case selections. However, according to ONRR officials, the agency is considering discontinuing the use of its current model in favor of one that is internally developed. Internal acquisition guidance requires that federal agencies determine the effectiveness of such models. Without a periodic analysis of its use of the model, ONRR is not also determining whether its use is increasing findings of royalty noncompliance and increasing additional royalty revenues. Thus, Interior and its member states covering royalties for federal properties used a generally reasonable approach in conducting compliance activities but lacking a documented case selection process, accurate alignment of case selection with ONRR's goals, and a periodic evaluation of the use of the risk model make it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these efforts towards its mission and goals. GAO recommends that ONRR take further steps to improve the audit process and ensure future improvements. Specifically, ONRR should, among other things, establish a case selection process and performance measures and track each state's contribution to ONRR's compliance goals. Interior concurred with all seven of the recommendations.","Since 1986, FAS citizens have been able to migrate to U.S. areas and live and work in the United States indefinitely, absent later decision by the United States to terminate the compact. The United States has contributed to U.S. aid to FASs in various forms, including funds provided through compacts with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. GAO was asked to provide information on the impact of compact migration on U.S. national interests, governments, or communities. This report, among other things, (1) presents estimates of compact migrant populations in selected U.S. areas and describes recent trends, and (2) describes the effects of compact migration in Hawaii, Guam, the CNMI, Arkansas, Oregon, and Washington. GAO analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Interior (Interior), and State; conducted interviews with selected officials; and interviewed stakeholders in the selected U.S. areas. From about 1995 to 2011, compact migrants in U.S. states and territories steadily increased from 13,237 estimates, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). That number of compact migrants in U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories outside the territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) dropped, and compact migrants in Guam and the CNMI dropped from a peak before 1995 to a low in 2011, only to increase within the next 7 years, according to ACS and Interior enumeration data, which were cautions that may not fully reflect compact migrants numbers as margins of error exist and data were not available for all areas. With the compacts of free association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, citizens of the freely associated states have migrated to areas in the United States, establishing service workers, students, and military and airline personnel, primarily in Hawaii. The three affected jurisdictions of Hawaii, Guam, and the CNMI reported continued growth in estimated costs related to services they said were caused by compact migrants, or “compact impact,” reaching $3.2 billion or more during the period fiscal years 2004 through 2018. According to Interior officials, the overpayments that occurred because of undercounts of compact migrants in Hawaii and resulting overunder-allocations of grants to Hawaii, Guam, Guang, American Samoa, in fiscal years 2015 through 2020 will be corrected starting in 2021. Selected U.S. areas that GAO visited reported a range of effects of compact migration, including budgetary and economic contributions, workforce and community impacts, and concerns about public policy and public health issues. For example, state and territorial government officials said that, because of U.S. fees and taxes they said are levied on compact migrants, governments receiving compact migrants receive a benefit. However, they also described budgetary and other costs, such as costs of providing translators or interpreters or reimbursement for emergency services, associated with providing citizens of the freely associated states with access to potentially life-saving health care and other public services. However, for other compact migrants living in the United States without health care coverage, some governments and health care providers committed to enrolling them in Medicare and Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program or established a program where they could have access to medical and dental care and apply for reimbursement for the care they have received. Many compact migrants work in a range of industries, such as manufacturing and healthcare, as seen in example locations of, among other activities, a poultry processing industry where most Marshallese employees oversee plant activities but many FAS citizens work in its production sector. Some U.S. Remarks made on this report include assertions that compact migrants including unreported estimates of the migrant population in Arkansas as well as sharing their observations that the compacts have supported the growth and development of receiving areas. Other concerns of Marhsallese residents as well as an account of immigration policy discussed in an House Report 114-966, to amend the Compact of Free Association Agreement involving the County of Palau, require that in Debt Relief Notification, the President should explain how the action ensures that the views of the Congress are incorporated in the notification. Specifically, the Report states: 'The Committee believes that there should be a specific mechanism to provide information on Compact migrants' impacts on U.S. areas funding reimbursed and considered miscellaneous and, therefore, has included a provision in the bill for GAO to analyze how the U.S. areas that are most impacted by Compact migration should be reimbursed for the costs of providing such support. GAO is to: (1) Identify the relationship between Compact migrants with Compact Impact on U.S. areas and whether U.S. reimburse Congressional Review Act. This is even though both bills have been signed into law. So even though Congress asked that GAO be required to determine whether U.S. costs reimbursement even issues are issues that need to under consideration and accurate payment and support to addresses Compact migration Sec. 232 amends the Controlled Substances Act (22 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.) to require the Department of Health and Human Services, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), to employ the performance measures identified by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine established by the committee to gather information on the substance use, abuse, and addiction of prisoners and parolees. are still pending differing requirements regarding Forum migrant study requirements for compacts maritime interdiction and drug smuggling issues regarding the good neighbor policy.

Certain provisions in NNCAA will sunset in 2020. Several bills have been introduced in the 116th Congress to address this U.S. territory's immigration system, including H.R. 560, which was the subject of a hearing held by the Committee on Resources, House of Representatives on March 20, 2019. H.R. 560 proposes a nationalization program for certain noncitizen workers and investors in the CNMI and would change various legal classifications for them so they would meet U.S. immigration requirements. H.R. 560 includes a provision for GAO to report on certain aspects of workforce and immigration data for the CNMI. This testimony addresses: (1) the numbers and origins of noncitizens working in the CNMI who may be eligible for authorization to permanently reside in the NNCAA-preferred CNMI under H.R. 560 and (2) strategy for DHS management of recent downturns in the CW-1 worker program in the CNMI. GAO's analysis is based on previous reports issued in 2017, data from the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) provided under the Freedom of Information Act, USCIS statements and testimony, and DHS documents for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. GAO also interviewed USCIS officials. GAO has made no new recommendations. For fiscal years 2015 through 2018, USCIS data show that most holders of permits (CW-1 permits) under the CNMI and United States Citizenship Act of 2007 (NNCAA) (the codification of the CNMI and US-CNM immigration laws) were from the Philippines or China, and most of these workers were eligible for various workforce and immigration classifications under H.R. 560 (a bill proposed in the 116th Congress): First, GAO found that under H.R. 560, many foreign workers who had filed in fiscal year 2018 and whose permits had been approved may meet new U.S. immigration eligibility requirements for certain statuses recognized by U.S. immigration law, such as U.S. resident status for certain workers or investor statuses for workers who seek to invest in the CNMI economy. Second, the number of workers from the Philippines granted CW-1 permits for fiscal years 2015-2018 significantly caressed that of workers from other areas, the most notable being that four times more Chinese were granted CW-1 permits than were granted in fiscal year 2015. Third, foreign workers from the Philippines also comprised the majority of the workers in the majority of the 18 workforce categories, according to SCNria data. Finally, more than 80 percent of those foreign workers were born in the Philippines, according to USCIS data. USCIS officials have developed strategies for managing the significant downturn in the workforce of CW-1 permit holders working in the CNMI since 2015. The number of CW-1 permits USCIS administers has declined by 44 percent since fiscal year 2016. USCIS also reported that the number of foreign workers working in the CNMI had dropped by about 20 percent during the past 2 years as some of these workers returned to their countries of origin, were hired away to work in other countries where employment was more favorable, or retired due to age and for other reasons. Officials have reported that there are fewer inexpensive beach-front houses available in the Commonwealth for foreign workers to rent, one thing making living in the Commonwealth less desirable. Some foreign workers in the CNMI have begun hiring other workers with lower wages than those currently working while other foreign workers who changed occupations, including those that ime-ef turned lowly paid construction work to guest workers, employed additional foreign workers in select fields jobs.","NRC sets service fees for activities such as inspecting nuclear licensees and annual fees based on the amount of the annual appropriation. In fiscal year 2019, NRC collected about $945 million in fees through its service and annual fees. NRC also receives funding through appropriations. For fiscal year 2020, the President's Budget request contains about $851 million in appropriations. GAO and NRC internal initiatives have identified challenges within NRC's fee-setting, billing, and budgeting processes. For example, not all stakeholders have the ability to effectively plan for future work because of challenges in understanding fees. GAO was asked to review NRC's budgeting processes. This report examines the extent to which NRC has implemented recommended improvements to its processes for (1) setting service and annual fees, (2) billing licensees for services, and (3) allocating and obligating appropriations. GAO reviewed federal regulations and NRC documents; interviewed officials from selected NRC program offices, including the Office of the Chief Financial Officer; and interviewed officials from 11 private-sector organizations—selected for their diversity and size—and reviewed documents for the 11 licensees. Since 2017, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has implemented changes to its service and annual fee-setting, billing, and budgeting processes in response to GAO and internal NRC findings and recommendations to address challenges previously raised by federal, state, and private sector stakeholders, such as Congressional committees, state agencies, state governors, and licensees. Service and annual fees. NRC made changes that generally conform with the recommendations. Specifically, NRC posted examples of calculations, enhanced transparency of work, and created performance measures for transparency and timeliness. Billing. NRC improved transparency by standardizing and updating billing codes and invoices, providing supplemental billing information through a standard form, and posting public cost estimates for common regulatory actions. It also implemented a standardized process to validate charges, enhanced the timeliness of the service fee billing process by implementing an electronic billing system, but did not further enhance transparency and the ability of the public to estimate costs because: NRC does not clearly define what costs are included across public cost estimates. While NRC did create public cost estimates to enhance transparency and facilitate planning for future costs, it has not conducted clear and succinct analysis and has not consistently defined what costs are included across all six estimates—a need for clear cost estimates was identified during NRC's Fees Transformation Initiative. Without enhanced transparency about these costs, it is not clear what additional costs stakeholders face when NRC performs these activities. NRC implemented changes to its budgeting process from 2017 through 2019 as follows: Budget justification. NRC began presenting actual obligation data in its annual budget justification for fiscal years 2018 through 2020, to increase transparency. Before 2018, NRC did not present this information, and it was difficult for users to determine how NRC was disbursing appropriations. NRC's obligations for corporate support were reduced in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal years 2016 through 2018, but corporate support expenditure as a percentage of NRC obligation increased slightly. Budget formulation and execution system. NRC began the upgrade phase for the systems used to formulate and execute NRC's budget in fiscal year 2019 after starting initial planning in fiscal year 2018. The upgrades come several years after a recommendation from NRC's Office of Inspector General. Until GAO assesses the impact of the upgrades, it is unclear whether they will further enhance budget formulation and execution. GAO recommends that NRC provide guidance to enhance transparency by defining, on a portion of its public cost estimates where clear and succinct analysis exists, what costs are included, and for when and in what way to communicate the status of ongoing regulatory activities. NRC neither agreed nor disagreed with these recommendations.","Since fiscal year 2014, noncitizens apprehended at the southwest border and arrested or detained elsewhere in the country have increasingly expressed a fear of returning to their country of origin and may file a fear claim with DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as appropriate. Key aspects of the fear claim process call for applicants to be screened to determine whether they have a credible or reasonable fear of persecution or torture. Post-screening, applicants for whose expedited removal proceedings have not been issued a final removal order—or, for individuals for whom full removal proceedings were initiated—may request an immigration judge to review USCIS's determination. GAO was asked to evaluate processing of fear claims by USCIS and EOIR. This report examines (1) what USCIS and EOIR data show about the credible and reasonable fear processes, (2) the extent to which USCIS has policies and procedures for overseeing credible and reasonable fear screenings, and (3) the extent to which USCIS and EOIR have processes for managing their respective credible and reasonable fear-related workloads. To conduct this review, GAO analyzed relevant data from three DHS components and Justice's EOIR, as well as reviewed relevant policies and training materials. GAO observed U.S. ICE facilities and conducted offices site visits, and interviewed U.S. government officials from DHS headquarters and eight USCIS asylum offices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) made positive determinations in most of its screenings for credible and reasonable fear from fiscal years 2014 to 2019. According to USCIS, from fiscal year 2014 to the first two quarters of fiscal year 2019— the most current data available at the time of GAO's review—USCIS asylum officers made positive determinations in about 71 percent of all credible and reasonable fear screenings. With respect to reasoned fear screenings, which determine if an applicant's fear is genuine or can be proven, USCIS officers made positive determinations in about 30 percent of all reasonable fear screenings. During the same time period, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)—an Office within the Department of Justice (DOJ) that oversees or manages immigration court operations across the country—upheld USCIS negative determinations in about 77 percent of specific credible and reasonable fear review requests made by applicants. At the same time, applicants may file applications for asylum and extending withholding of removal as protections once they are in full immigration proceedings. USCIS aspects of the credible and reasonable fear process have policies and procedures in place as required by regulation, and for certain processing activities, but these are not always consistently enforced. USCIS requires asylum officers to follow specific procedures for credible and reasonable fear screenings, which include selecting and interviewing applicants, checking their background, and conducting quality reviews. Further, USCIS supervises officers and provides training, but not all asylum offices provide officers with training on specific procedures for credible and reasonable fear before they begin screening cases at DHS family residential centers. Finally, USCIS uses quality assurance reviews to identify trends by asylum office, but its use of these reviews potentially hinders tracking trends by office because its process for collecting and reporting the information collected during the reviews is not consistent across offices. USCIS and EOIR have processes for managing their respective credible and reasonable fear-related workloads . USCIS relies primarily on a national staffing model to staff offices for credible and reasonable fear and allocates staff at the local level. Three asylum offices account for the greatest percentage of asylum officer detail assignments to the family residential centers as of fiscal year 2018, also showed more detailed training for their officers on credible and reasonable fear screenings. US Citizenship and Immigration Services uses timeliness goals to monitor when its officers complete credible and reasonable fear cases, but the case records it maintains do not include some necessary detail on the reasons for delays with which these cases are stuck in its processing system and remain confidential. EOIR relies on procedures for assigning judges for its credible and reasonable fear workload. EOIR immigration judges, but not USCIS asylum officers, conduct reviews of USCIS negative determinations. EOIR conducts reviews to ensure that immigration judges complete them within a required time frame and has a number of mechanisms in place for monitoring compliance. GAO recommends, among others, that USCIS develop and implement more specific guidance on requirements for documenting results of quality assurance reviews; provide additional training to officers before they screen credible and reasonable fear cases at ICE family residential centers, and collect and analyze additional information on where staff can speed up processing for credible and reasonable fear cases. DHS concurred with all GAO's recommendations.","Advanced technologies—a term used here to mean a range of technologies such as AI, robotics, and machine vision that could be used to automate tasks performed by workers—are potentially transforming many sectors of the economy. Some studies estimate that recent and emerging technologies will greatly affect the U.S. workforce. For example, the National Academies stressed the importance of governments and other stakeholders understanding these changes as well as monitoring and evaluating how they are affecting the workforce. Section 902 of Title X of P.L. 115-174 includes a provision for GAO to review the effects of advanced technologies on the U.S. workforce. GAO was asked to assess, for example, what is known about the use of such technologies. GAO analyzed federal data to examine indications of changes in employment trends and concentrated occupations and workers susceptible to automation; identified ongoing efforts to track and monitor workforce and technology effects; and visited firms selected for their use of advanced technologies. To identify selected firms, GAO obtained input from various stakeholders, including academic researchers, technology developers, and state economic development officials. The adoption and workforce effects of advanced technologies are difficult to measure because of complexities in job-task interactions and uncertainties about when or how technology adoption will occur. The Departments of Labor (DOL) and Commerce report that they are aware of the potential for advanced technologies to change the economy and the workforce. However, current data that reflect these dynamics generally are limited. For example, some recent federal data collection methods attempt to track or predict technology effects, such as a new Census Bureau survey that is to focus in part on the technology adoption process. However, the usefulness of this new information, if it is collected and available in the future, is unproven. In effect, as DOL noted, government data are not systematically identifying information about whether changes in employment levels are due, for example, to worker displacement as a result of advanced technologies. This limits the government's ability to be proactive in helping workers affected by technology-driven structural changes in the service-producing part of the economy, as well as to understand the extent of the economic and other benefits associated with advanced technologies. Tending to guide future workforce programs are DOL's workforce information and training goals, which state that inform workers about available job options and get the right workers or services to jobs and employers. DOL data could be used to collect and assess information systematically, which could help inform current and future work efforts. DOL officials said they identify a useful part of ongoing federal data collection efforts extending agreement to collect workforce data to analyze the impact of new technologies. The officials also stated that developing ways to collect this information could be a valuable follow-on to that effort. According to DOL, it will continue coordinating with Commerce on research and other activities in this area, including survey efforts. It is therefore important that, as that effort continues, DOL fulfill its publicly-stated intent to identify ways to augment existing data with additional information to better understand technological effects on employment. However, short of such an effort by DOL, information produced in new surveys will not be of immediate, practical utility to jobs training or guidance programs, even if some Census data will be available in the near future. The potentially very large and observable effects on individual workers and businesses from advanced technologies limit the ability of the government, industry, and labor unions to fully understand the changes. GAO was unable to complete a review on the size of these effects. Selected firms' reasons for adopting advanced technologies. GAO met with 17 firms, executing a total of four site visits. GAO used various techniques to select firms for the review, including consulting knowledgeable individuals and examining internet job postings to identify, among other things, firms' use of advanced technologies. GAO selected firms that use advanced technologies, knew of technology developers in the sector, and had workforce effects due to their use of technologies. All use of names, acronyms, and other identifying information for the firms is intended to protect the identifiable personal and proprietary information of confidential corporate privacy figures (i.e., of individuals), and does not denote affiliation with an agency of the U. S. or a Department of Defense (DoD) component. GAO also met with seven technology developers and two systems integrators in addition to officials from DOL, Commerce, and other agencies. GAO analyzed data and various survey methods used by the agencies. GAO also identifies ways to improve DOL's efforts to collect workforce information on the impact of new technologies. DOL agreed with the recommendation.","DOD has made efforts to increase female representation within the services, encourage female participation and retention, and promote females into leadership positions. In January 2013, the Secretary of Defense directed that women be eligible to serve in all positions in which they are qualified, which was codified by statute in 2015. In 2019, DOD reported that 15.5 percent of active-duty servicemembers are female, as compared to more than 50 percent of the U.S. population. GAO previously recommended that DOD and the military services develop plans to recruit and retain female and minority servicemembers. GAO was asked to review the percentage of female active-duty servicemembers and factors associated with their retention. This report examines (1) trends in active-duty servicemembers, including their attrition rates, and reported factors leading to that attrition; (2) female active-duty servicemember promotion rates and factors that influence those rates; and (3) whether DOD and the services have plans to guide and monitor female active-duty servicemember recruitment and retention. GAO reviewed and analyzed fiscal year 2004 through 2018 active-duty personnel data for all pay grades and ranks; reviewed documents on the services' data on diversity, retention, and recruitment; reviewed studies and literature on female active-duty servicemember retention; and interviewed department and service officials. GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the services, and each of the military services develop plans to guide and monitor recruitment and retention efforts of female active-duty servicemembers with goals and performance measures. DOD and the services concurred with GAO's recommendations and stated actions being taken or that will be taken. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the services have made efforts to create opportunities for women and individuals from underrepresented demographics to participate in the military. GAO's analysis of 15 years of data found that the services' populations of female active-duty servicemembers increased slightly from service to service between 15 percent and 20 percent from fiscal year 2004 through 2018. The percentage of female active-duty servicemembers increased over the full 15 year period. Upward trend line of overall percent of female active-duty servicemembers from FY 2004-2018. However, data also show that these women were less likely than their male counterparts to remain in the service over time. Data show that unidentified female and male servicemembers, whose reason for separation could not be identified as misconduct, family, pregnancy, etc., constitute the majority of female attrition from fiscal years 2004 through 2018. Studies have identified other factors for female active-duty servicemembers' decisions to separate, including work schedules, deployments, organizational culture, family planning, and sexual assault. From fiscal years 2004 through 2018, GAO found that the percentage of female active-duty servicemembers' promotions was slightly lower among enlisted in most years, but higher for officers compared to their male counterparts. GAO estimated that, within each service, the likelihood of women's promotion varied depending on the occupational category and service. Analysis of studies found that DOD has identified diversity as important, but the department and the military services do not have plans to guide and monitor female active-duty servicemember recruitment and retention efforts. The Office of the Secretary of Defense, among other things, updated its 2012-2017 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan to guide efforts through 2024. However, the plan does not contain specific goals or targets, such as recruitment or retention targets, specific to female servicemembers. In its 2017 report, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services recommended that the services have specific goals to increase representation of women and provide a clear definition of the qualifications for each grade level in their personnel systems. According to the services, no specific goals, performance measures, or timeframes have been set for the services to increase representation of female active-duty servicemembers. Until the department develops strategies for enhancing the retention and promotion of women, it may fall short of achieving a highly diverse force and may continue to experience a decrease in the percentage of females in the force, despite opportunities for them to participate in previously restricted career fields. GAO recommends that DOD direct the services and each service develop goals, performance measures, and timeframes to guide and monitor female active-duty servicemember recruitment and retention efforts. DOD and the services concurred with the recommendations and stated actions being taken or that will be taken.","Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is a federal student loan program that allows eligible borrowers to receive forgiveness on the remaining balance of their loans. However, about 99 percent of borrowers originally eligible for the program have been denied over the last 5 years due to a variety of reasons, including that they had not made the required 120 qualifying payments. Congress appropriated $700 million to provide a temporary expansion of loan forgiveness through 2018 for up to 22,000 borrowers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness Temporary Expansion (TEPSLF) who could not qualify for PSLF because they were repaying their loans using plans that did not qualify. Having provided TEPSLF loans totaling about $27 million, Congress extended the appropriation for an additional 5 years prior to reauthorization and additional funding. TEPSLF loan forgiveness will continue to be available on a first-come, first-served basis until the appropriation is spent. GAO was asked to review Education's efforts to implement TEPSLF. In this report, GAO examines (1) the TEPSLF application process, (2) how Education has handled TEPSLF requests, (3) how Education informs borrowers about TEPSLF, and (4) how Education's TEPSLF application process has helped borrowers. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed officials and borrowers. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of seven TEPSLF applications; federal internal control standards for communication; and selected relevant federal student loan laws, regulations, and policies. The Department of Education (Education) pays contractors to assist in the administration of loan forgiveness programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Temporary Expansion (TEPSLF) program. The TEPSLF loan servicer is the current and only servicer contracted to administer TEPSLF. GAO found that Education's TEPSLF loan forgiveness process was confusing for borrowers and did not adequately guide borrowers on what to do if service was denied. Key findings are as follows: Borrowers can only begin the process of requesting TEPSLF loan forgiveness after submitting a separate, first stage application to the PSLF program, even though the two programs have largely the same eligibility requirements. Nine of 11 borrowers or borrower representatives GAO interviewed stated that having to apply separately for these two programs confused borrowers and, in their opinion, led directly to large numbers of TEPSLF denials. Education added the application step to help roll out the TEPSLF program within the 60-day time frame established in the legislation creating TEPSLF. However, this narrow, temporary solution created confusion as borrowers were trying to access the TEPSLF loan forgiveness opportunity that was designed to help certain borrowers who were ineligible for the PSLF program. Integrating the TEPSLF loan forgiveness request into existing PSLF application processes would improve service to borrowers. About 38 percent of borrowers whose TEPSLF requests were denied were not considered for loan forgiveness because they had not yet submitted a PSLF application. Borrowers who received a denial letter may have already been making qualifying monthly payments, including paying at least 10 years in public service work, potentially going without financial rewards while expecting loan forgiveness. However, this group of borrowers may also have had questions about the eligibility requirements for the two programs and the TEPSLF application process. Borrowers who wish to contest the denial of their TEPSLF request are not provided with all information about their options to do so. An FSA official stated that no additional information is included because the loan servicer's customer service phone number is located on all denial letters. For example, Education's loan service outline shows the customer service number and that representatives will do additional reviews if needed. FSA officials stated that in some cases when a disputing borrower revises their appeal to include information they had previously provided, their new eligibility is higher, and even if that is not their final determination, we will resolve this for them. Borrowers who are denied loan forgiveness are sent the same letter regardless of their specific reason for being denied. For example, borrowers who are denied for not having 120 qualifying payments are not told that they could also consider filing a complaint with Education in addition to calling the customer service number. Providing additional information about options available to borrowers in denial letters would increase borrowers' ability to successfully appeal the loan servicer's determination. The loan servicer conducts outreach to borrowers who it believes are most likely to be eligible for TEPSLF, but Education's TEPSLF outreach could be improved. For example, Education and the TEPSLF loan servicer conduct direct outreach to borrowers who may be eligible for the short-term reprieve in loan forgiveness funding Congress provided. However, Education and loans servicer are not yet hosting a single outreach site with information on both programs. GAO recommends that Education take actions to improve TEPSLF borrowing.","U.S. air carriers have increased cooperation through international air alliances to encourage competition and improve customer service. Cooperative agreements between U.S. and foreign carriers must be submitted for approval to DOT and may originally include a request for antitrust immunity from antitrust laws that can limit certain types of cooperation, such as joint pricing. DOT reviews an application for antitrust immunity according to its procedures for adjudicating a public-interest proceeding. DOT periodically reports on the effects of granted immunity, including estimated benefits for consumers. GAO was asked to review DOT's approval and monitoring processes, as well as DOT's reporting on the effects of immunized agreements. This report discusses (1) DOT processes for approving cooperative agreements and granting antitrust immunity, and its assessments of likely effects, and (2) DOT's monitoring activities and reporting on the effects of grants of antitrust immunity. GAO reviewed relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, relevant DOT documentation and court decisions, and cases with antitrust immunity from January 1993 through December 2018. GAO also interviewed DOT officials, airline and other relevant stakeholders, and analyzed relevant data. The Department of Transportation (DOT) reviews antitrust immunity applications, based on its analysis, pursuant to its statutory processes for reviewing applications for approval of cooperative agreements and grants of immunity. DOT analyzes competitive and public benefit effects of proposed agreements, taking into consideration the potential effects on consumers. For these analyses, DOT uses the professional experience and expertise of staff to identify and assess relevant market factors, the terms of a proposed cooperative agreement, supporting documents, and other information in light of the facts and circumstances specific to each case. DOT's experience has shown that many of the cooperative agreements it has devised may also produce significant consumer benefits. Additional consumer benefits that arise from agreements not approved by the department, without immunity, may be unlikely or occur a greater time into the future. DOT has also provided insight into the principles of these analyses in publicly available orders issued in reasoned decisions. GAO found that these analyses provide useful context to understand the rationale behind airline industry trends and competitive dynamics. DOT issues these orders as part of its public process to consider applications, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Its monitoring activities are undertaken to track the implementation of cooperative agreements and assure carriers comply with the terms of immunity grants, and pay significant attention to whether and how grants of immunity affect consumers. DOT mandates annual, specific, confidential reports on carrier participation in immunized agreements. DOT officials noted that periodic voluntary reporting of these activities would be appropriate to communicate quality information to decision makers and others. For example, all aspects of a proceeding's public record, according to DOT officials, already provide relevant history, considerations and determinations regarding the effects of these agreements, including immunity, and related conditions. DOT could also report on specific aspects of its monitoring and assessments, which, according to GAO's review of publicly available information, would help ensure proper accountability and maintain sufficient public input and belief in quality oversight. Further, such reporting should be consistent with statutory guidance that aims to avoid diffusion of information to competitors, carriers, or other entities associated with potential future or ongoing cases, but still provides neutral, general information about the outcomes ofDOT's monitoring activities. DOT and the Department of Justice separately provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. DOT's comments did not address elements of the recommendation fully and raised concerns about the recommendation's feasibility, but DOT agreed to take several actions. As discussed in the report, GAO continues to believe that GAO's recommendation, as written, would address key areas of improvement in the application of DOT internal control principles.","Leaks of natural gas from underground storage sites in the United States have affected nearby communities and property, but widespread public health events or environmental catastrophes have not been reported, although this could be due to lack of reporting and oversight. In November 2015, a large leak at a natural gas storage site in Los Angeles County, California, became the largest release from a storage site in U.S. history. An interagency task force was established to study the incident and report on incident effects and mitigation strategies. GAO was asked to review the regulations for natural gas storage sites. This report addresses (1) the extent to which PHMSA has developed its natural gas storage program since GAO's November 2017 report, (2) what is known about potential health effects from chemicals in stored natural gas, and (3) what is known about environmental effects from stored natural gas releases. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed federal officials from PHMSA, other agencies, and industry representatives, as well as officials from selected states. In November 2017, GAO reported that the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) had established a goal for its program to reduce workplace accidents attributable to unsafe pipelines and improve industry safety but had not developed performance goals to guide it. GAO recommended that PHMSA address key aspects of leading practices for strategic planning. DOT concurred with the report's recommendations. PHMSA has begun inspecting underground natural gas storage sites consistent with leading strategic planning practices, but PHMSA may not be able to meet its performance goals within the next 5 years due to factors that affect states' participation in inspections. For example, of the 25 states that were expected to participate, 15 states said they were interested but had not yet done so, and officials from 2 of these states said that the lack of sufficient funds was a reason for this. According to PHMSA, the Pipeline Integrity, Safety, and Environmental Protection Act of 2016 required that PHMSA establish standards for natural gas storage and that it set user fees to help cover the cost of regulation. PHMSA issued regulations in December 2016. Although federal regulations generally apply to natural gas storage wells, there is no list of natural gas storage chemicals. GAO identified three reports, along with federal and industry data on chemical components, to identify chemicals that may be present in natural gas in concentrated amounts. Some chemicals are used in, and occur naturally in, stored natural gas. Some natural gas storage sites use natural chemicals added to natural gas, such as odorants to help identify leaks or fire suppressants to help reduce fire risks from leaks. These chemicals have potential environmental health effects. Federal agencies have documented the potential effects of several chemicals that can be present in natural gas storage, including benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. Health effects from exposure to the chemicals include drowsiness, dizziness and unconsciousness, destruction of bone marrow, and weakness. GAO also found that gas releases from natural gas storage sites contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but identified only two reports that provide information on the groundwater impacts from three storage site releases from 2000 to 2019, according to a state and local study and PHMSA incident reports. Reports are limited in part because of the lack of a federal listing of chemical components of stored gas. In response to GAO's November 2017 report, freeze on natural gas storage regulations was lifted and PHMSA gained safety over specific underground storage sites—a gap in previous regulation. GAO is making two recommendations, including that PHMSA analyze the factors affecting states' willingness to participate in inspections and analyze the agency's workforce needs on an ongoing basis to inform its budget requests. DOT concurred with the report's recommendations and provided additional information on steps it is taking or plans to take as part of its implementation of the underground natural gas storage program.","Small-space lavatories—such as those on single-aisle aircraft—can create problems for persons with mobility impairments or conditions that limit their access to aircraft bathrooms, although neither the ACAA nor any DOT regulations require single-aisle aircraft lavatories to be accessible to such consumers. Federal law requires that aviators furnish an accessible passthrough for the transportation of wheelchairs. However, passengers onboard single-aisle aircraft using wheelchairs may need to transfer to smaller lavatories provided with an available seat. The VARCHAR of 1995 requires that, for each aircraft model, passengers be able to operate independently without assistance. Accessible air travel, including lavatory accommodations, was cited in Congress as a priority for studies. This report provides information on: (1) available aircraft and lavatory designs; (2) the number of aircraft, if any, that have planes accommodating wheelchairs; and (3) the nature and frequency with which DOT and selected air carriers receive passenger complaints about the accessibility of aircraft lavatories. GAO determined the availability of lavatory designs and interviewed U.S. passport and visa holders (DOT). GAO examined U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) accommodation under civil rights laws sheltered under the federal antidiscrimination Title III in Section 504 of the ACAA deceptive, unfair or discriminatory treatment to individuals with disabilities in all programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. Of those federal programs, rehabilitation professionals, and science based light or dark became identified will explain accessible a runway capability. GAO selected air carriers by revenue, number of employees, 2018 trip origin and destination, whether wheelchair-accessible lavatories were available on their careset, and historical operating experience. The data as of mid-October and mid-November 2019 were supplemented with current and historical data where appropriate. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives few passenger complaints related to aircraft lavatories. This report reviews aircraft lavatory designs offered by manufacturers (Airbus and Boeing), the proportion of their use, and airline and passenger perspectives on the issues. DOT receives few passenger complaints and did not provide specific data on the frequency of such complaints as airlines routinely address passenger inquiries. Up to 1 in 5 of Americans have disabilities and may be affected by or have concerns about the accessibility of lavatory spaces on aircraft, and other laws require certain improvements to the over 3 million U.S. registered aircraft lavatories. Both Airbus and Boeing offer their customers a range of standard and wheelchair-accessible lavatory designs, although the wheelchair-accessible designs constitute about 4.5 percent of the single-aisle aircraft fleet of the selected major air carriers. According to manufacturers and air carrier officials, the wheelchair-accessible lavatories offer features passengers with mobility issues can use, although the decision to acquire these, which reduce the number of seating rows onboard, is made with consideration for competing priorities, including providing in-flight meal service. Key stakeholders GAO spoke with also raised concerns that available lavatory designs are limited in that carriers often do not have information about which of their aircraft have wheelchair-accessible lavatories, and whether or not a passenger can travel on an aircraft with such accommodations is uncertain. According to airlines, passengers may contact them to determine if an flight has a wheelchair-accessible lavatory, although not all representatives are likely to be able to provide this information readily. Furthermore, while carriers and DOT receive only a small number of complaints about lavatories in general, it is unknown whether certain consumers are less likely to complain. For example, they may choose not to fly or take other steps to forego the risk of facing problems with wheelchairs accessing aircraft lavatories. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOT. DOT provided technical comments but did not comment on the comparison in the number of complaints processed to general Remarks made on appeal to General Aviation Rule to gate including unaccessable small commercial flights.","Since the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been under the conservatorship of FHFA. Several reforms have been developed that address strategy for the enterprises and the broader U.S. housing finance system. Key objectives of this report were to examine (1) recent developments in the housing and financial markets that could affect housing finance entities; (2) risks and challenges that conservatorships pose to the status and operations of the enterprises and other aspects of the housing finance system; and (3) reform options that have been proposed and their relative strengths and limitations. To achieve these objectives, GAO analyzed housing market data and examined existing documents such as FHFA's conservatorship portfolio and properties reports, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac financial reports, and 14 reform proposals that discuss alternatives to their current structure. The housing market has recovered since the 2007–2009 financial crisis, with significant federal government support. For example, total housing originations—mortgage volume—and house prices have been generally rising, and federally insured housing loans have increased significantly. Consistent economic growth, declining unemployment, and low mortgage rates also have contributed to recovery. The federal government has continued to bear risk for many mortgages through guarantees on MBS issued annually since 2008, but recently emerging market trends, such as the increased role of nonbank lenders and servicers, may present new challenges. Several indicators, including some loosening of underwriting standards, suggest that a lack of federal safety and soundness oversight for nonbanks could pose risks to entities within the housing finance system. The continued duration of conservatorships of the two major government-sponsored entities may also pose significant challenges. The enterprises are exposed to financial risks and the government has provided $191 billion to the enterprises through a senior preferred stock purchase agreement. Under this agreement, Treasury also may need to provide additional support as warranted by the enterprises' financial situations. The long duration of conservatorships also may create more uncertainty in the market and for the enterprises' strategies. Housing finance reform models GAO reviewed generally recognize the tribes of federal fiscal exposure, protect investors, and emphasize regulatory infrastructure. However, proposals vary regarding clearly defined goals or consideration of other relevant entities in the housing finance system. Nine of 14 proposals freeze or lower capital requirements for these entities. Ten proposals seek to eliminate over specific debt-income thresholds (43 percent). However, nine of the proposals had unclear goals and/or did not consider the extending agreement impacts, as do the enterprises in conservatorship; eight of the aspects namely, to not incentivize risk taking, homeownership and the goals at lower prices. According to five of the six reform models the proposals that reconstitute the enterprises' and respectively for or issuers. For example, FHFA recommended that they and other guarantors operate as utilities and another that the enterprises remain in the new system they create and have a majority owned by lenders instead of shareholders. Pricing remains ime-efinetly incentives for them to compete on underserved groups of developers, and assist. In addition, it remains unclear when the reforms will occur. лаборатор","Households nearing traditional retirement age may have four main retirement resources to finance living expenses and assets to sustain them in the event of unforeseen expenses. The most recent recession, persistent income and wealth disparities, delayed retirement, and recent downturns in financial markets could have continued to affect older Americans' retirement security, as GAO found in previous reports. This report examines how growing disparities in income and wealth affect older Americans' retirement security, using 1989 to 2016 national survey data for all older Americans and a nationally representative survey of individuals born from 1931 through 1941, among other things. GAO reviewed literature; analyzed 1989 to 2016 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, analyzed 1992 to 2014 data from the Health and Retirement Study, and interviewed experts. GAO is not making recommendations, as this report only provides summary information. Faster-growing income and wealth among some households in 1989 to 2016 resulted in increasing disparities, according to analysis of 1989 to 2016 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, a quarterly survey produced by the Federal Reserve. The Survey of Consumer Finances, a survey of a representative sample of households, asked about multiple sources of income and assets, although does not include nonretirement assets and was not designed for this analysis. For example, the average income for the top 20 percent of households was about $242,000 in 1989 compared to 2016 when it was about $398,000. These figures are net of debt and in 2016 dollars. GAO also found that the amount of wealth maintained by households in the top 20 percent was twice as high in 2016 as in 1989 and nearly the same for the bottom 20 percent. People with low or little net wealth may still receive Social Security or, in some cases, retirement account benefits as a major source of income in retirement. Aging Americans face longevity issues. GAO's analysis of a subset of individuals, those born from 1931 to 1941, found that the chance of survival to age ranges of 73-83 increased with each level of household income and wealth. Within income or wealth quintiles, other factors, such as poverty or poor health, do not always freeze length of life. Finally, among the lowest income/wealth individuals, 50 percent were alive in 2014, according to the Health and Retirement Study. These probabilities should not be interpreted as impacts, as GAO cannot determine whether these factors contribute to longevity, as other sources examined in the analysis also narrow the life expectancy gap. Remaining at work longer, and for gradually longer periods, reduces these issues, allowing for inexpensive and phased retirement. Federal and State Governments Can Assist Further by Promoting ContextTailored, Comprehensive Programs and Electronic Resources GAO previously reported that a comprehensive reevaluation of the nation's retirement system is needed to better promote future retirement security, in part, because of a lack of guidance for low-income workers.","DOD sponsors five FFRDCs through an annual contracting process, in accordance with authorization and delegation in statutes and NNligeid programs, and how adequately DOD prevented and mitigated potential conflicts of interest. GAO analyzed data on DOD FFRDC support, reviewed DOD studies and sponsoring agreements. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 22 projects for research to identify factors that influenced DOD's use of FFRDCs. GAO selected these projects for review based on available information that indicated that the projects were relevant to current policy issues as well as performed in a representative group of Centers. GAO analyzed documentation for compliance with the DOD instruction and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also interviewed representatives from the five S&A Centers and prior work sponsors for the selected projects. Certain findings are based on a non-generalizable sample and GAO does not intend to make generalizations to the larger population of DOD FFRDC projects. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. DOD generally concurred with our findings and GAO incorporated related technical comments as appropriate. The Department of Defense (DOD) sponsors five Federally Funded Research and Development Centers—Istit Yu Research (CNA), the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), the RAND Corporation's Center for Naval Analuength RRAresearch Institute's (RAND NDRI), and the RAND Arroyo Center (RAND Arroyo Center or Arroyo Center)—collectively referred to as Studies and Analyses (S&A) Centers, which have 32 years of relationships with DOD. Congress authorized and directed GAO to review DOD's use of S&A Centers. This report examines DOD's use and funding decisions for the Department of Defense (DOD)-sponsored FFRDCs and the results achieved as reflected in the research, factors that influenced the department's use of the centers, and whether DOD actions address issues related to the service members' use of FFRDCs and to DOD's ability to assess these centers' results and address the potential risks of conflicts of interest posed by FFRDCs. GAO analyzed budget and obligation data; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 22 FFRDC projects that were performed across these S&A Centers; reviewed DOD policies and instructions; and interviewed DOD officials, S&A Center officials and previous work sponsors. Since 2013, DOD's total annual obligations to the 10 DOD-sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) ranged from approximately $2.7 billion to about $3.2 billion, and for five of these, obligations were significantly influenced by annual inexpensive and Defense Staff Years of Technical Effort ceilings, which represent roughly one employee working for 1 year. Approximately 70 percent of DOD FFRDC obligations between fiscal years 2013 through 2018 went towards supporting non-intelligence programs, including research projects requested by DOD. Other than S&A Centers, obligations to other FFRDCs went to jobs related to, for example, engineering research and development activities. Research conducted by S&A Centers generally ranged from about $2,000 to $11 million annual. With the exception of two FFRDCs—Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment and the National Defense Research Institute—S&A Centers accounted for the remainder of the 18 percent of total annual non-intelligence obligations. Reasons for Use of FFRDCs . S&A Center acquisition and military department primary sponsors identified factors influencing DOD's decision to use these centers. Among other things, these factors included long-term strategic relationships with service members' primary sponsors and access to sensitive and proprietary data, DOD control over an FFRDC's business operations to limit the risk of conflicts, and in-depth subject-matter expertise reflecting the FFRDCs' long-term competencies as detailed with sharing their scope of work in sponsoring agreements with DOD. DOD's use of S&A Centers led to results such as supporting cost and program management improvements, as discussed in table below. Enabling Results . FFRDC Managers and Work Sponsors reported results to reflect the benefits of DOD's relationship with S&A Centers, and to a lesser extent they tracked how these results were implemented. RAND Arroyo Center has routinely tracked recommendations made to the Army with the Center's results and DOD is exploring tracking efforts. Commercial-language-sensitive conflict of interest policies . Each of the five S&A Centers GAO reviewed has widely applicable corporatewide conflict of interest staff policies developed in accordance with the Department of Defense's study that contained related elements that FFRDCs must follow in their documentation for use of, among other things, contractor time and funds. The Centers also take specific actions with regard to the elements. GAO's Findings. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, DOD's total annual obligations to DOD-sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Centers ranged from about $2.7 billion to approximately $3.2 billion. Over this period, approximately 70 percent of total Sec Defence obligations (i.e. Defense Staff Years of Technical Effort, referred to as Defense STE) to DOD- sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Centers went to support non-intelligence programs, which were comprised of obligations associated with utilized Defense STE. DOD researched requests to FFRDCs obtained from core competencies in acquired agreements, the Fed who head department sponsors FFRDCs are interested in differing capital undergo Forum research study requirements for wild printing maritime language project.

Yet, reliance only on VA's proposed acquisition will evade accountability to Congress and the public about the value of those expenditures. GAO examined the status of VistA. This testimony is based on GAO's April 2019 report, VA Should Have a Comprehensive Definition of Its VistA System and Develop a Reimbursable Cost Concept for the System. To conduct its work for that report, GAO reviewed VA documentation; interviewed agency officials, including at OIT, VHA, and the program managing the Cerner acquisition; visited the Springfield, VA, headquarters; Madison, WI; and Chicago, IL; and reviewed a nongeneralizable, nonprobability sample of VA documentation related to VistA, including procurement documents. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has an increasing reliance on information technology (IT) to support the delivery of clinical services to veterans, its mission, and goals. As part of this IT infrastructure, VA uses the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). The evolution of VistA is illustrative of the challenges VA has encountered in operating more than a million lines of code and thousands of new applications simultaneously without a departmentwide infrastructure that supports these systems' maintenance and sustainability. Documenting characteristics of, and defining, an IT system allows an agency to better manage and track its IT systems and programs—goals that include the totality of costs within an IT program's lifecycle. VA maintains multiple documents and a database that describe parts of VistA, including various components and interfaces as related to the system and its environment. However, despite these existing sources, VA officials acknowledged that there is no comprehensive definition that captures technical, functional, and environmental factors related to the system. This is due to VistA being locally developed without a single, coherent service-oriented model. Consequently, VA has completed a number of efforts to better define VistA and understand the environment in which it operates and additional work is planned in the future. Of the $2.3 billion total cost for VistA identified by the Office of Information and Technology for fiscal years 2015 through 2017, VA was able to sufficiently demonstrate the reliability of about 1 billion dollars ($903 million). VA demonstrated the reliability of the following seven categories of costs: VistA Evolution Program; Interoperability; Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Health; VA Contracts; Intergovernmental personnel acts; Memorandums of understanding; and Pay and administrative costs. The remaining $1.3 billion in costs were not demonstrated to be reliable, in part, because OIT was not able to provide credible estimates for such costs such as related software costs and certain VistA personnel costs. In addition, VA omitted certain VistA-related costs from its calculation including, for example, costs related to additional hosting and data standardization. As a result of VA's lack of a comprehensive or reliable estimate, the agency is not positioned to make informed management decisions for sustaining VistA over the next 10 years until its proposed acquisition is fully implemented. GAO recommends that VA develop and implement a methodology for reliably identifying and reporting the total costs of VistA. VA agreed with the recommendation.","DOD manages over 375,000 U.S. properties, including historic properties on its installations. Certain historic properties can be used to fulfill mission needs, for example, to house personnel and their families. Regulations require federal agencies to identify, evaluate, and protect historic properties in their control, among other things. GAO examined the extent to which DOD (1) identifies and evaluates properties for historic significance, including those that have been privatized, and (2) assesses the condition of its historic properties and has guidance on the training of installation personnel maintaining and those working in historic properties. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations; analyzed prior GAO reports and DOD data and guidance; and assessed preservation efforts at 10 non-generalizable properties chosen based on DOD data and variation in state, military services, and geographic location. GAO also interviewed DOD officials and preservation stakeholders. GAO identified gaps in data (e.g., linkage with privatized properties) and other data discrepancies, as well as some inconsistencies between the Department of Defense's (DOD) real property data and similar data collected from selected installations. Specifically, in an October 2017 report, GAO found that, of its approximately 375,000 properties, DOD has identified and evaluated about 60,000 as historic; 60,000 as not being historic; and has not yet evaluated the remaining roughly 258,000; about 41,000 of these are older than 50 years. The Department of Defense (DOD) guidance does not specify how properties that have not yet been evaluated within 50 years of being built should be treated. DOD officials stated that as properties are aged and a need for evaluation arises the properties are then identified and evaluated. However, the Department of the Interior's Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) officials said that while some properties may not need evaluation until they have reached a certain age, there are situations in which age alone may not be a good indicator of historic significance. Officials from two of the four State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO) DOD GAO interviewed also noted that DOD's stage-gate approach may not reflect the patchwork nature of historic preservation and inform how preservation issues ought to benefit broader historic preservation goals or when DOD might be better freeze on those properties therein worthwhile to assess. Military department officials GAO spoke to also stated that they have formally transferred the responsibility of unidentified and un-evaluated properties that are greater than or equal to 50 years old to private developers through agreements such as land-lease agreements and Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plans. However, private developers GAO spoke to at seven of the nine installations noted that they do not identify or evaluate any properties under their responsibility for historic significance and the two stated that they only identify and evaluate homes over 50 years old when they become sufficient aged. For maintenance and other requests for the repair or renovation of historic properties, DOD requires the installation level to inventory each property every 3 years, as long as a facility has been identified and evaluated as historic. Moreover, the Standard for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should communicate quality information so personnel can meet their roles in achieving objectives. However, for six of the 10 installations GAO visited, cultural resource officials said they were unaware of the requirement and thought updating their prior Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plans (ICRMP), a document developed under DOD's Cultural Resource Management Instruction, would be sufficient to comply with the requirement (these plans require that procedures are established for the maintenance of historic properties). DOD's guidance does not include specific language about the type of inventory required or how it should be conducted or reviewed and installational staff told us the 3-year requirement is more of an operating procedure, not a requirement. Until these requirements are made explicit, the preservation of DOD's historic facilities will continue to be hampered. Similarly installation resource managers at six of the 10 installations GAO visited said they did not obtain physical inventories of their facilities and did not have 3-year assessments of these facilities' conditions because they were unaware of the requirements or thought that the procedures in the 3-year inventory were consistent with the ICRMP requirement. As a result, DOD's headquarters may not have sufficient information on the conditions of these historic properties to effectively plan for the Department's future facilities needs. DOD requires cultural resource management personnel at installations that use historic properties, including those that have been privatized, to be trained so that they have the necessary knowledge to address issues related to the serviceability, maintenance, use, and preservation of cultural resources. GAO was told these training activities vary by installation. GAO found that, as a result, interpretations may vary about the extent of maintenance and repairs that can be done on these historic properties. GAO is making seven recommendations to enhance DOD's freeze on those properties therein worthwhile to assess and correct data discrepancies, clarify inventory specific procedures for historic properties, and provide training for cultural resource management and maintenance staff who address maintenance of historic properties. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.","Households rent over one-third of all U.S. housing units, and renters spend nearly a third of their income on rent on average, according to HUD. About one in five renters pays more than 50 percent of household income in rent. Many conditions can make rental units unaffordable or unhealthy, such as the keys found in figure. Federal programs help reduce housing costs for low-income households and encourage developers to create affordable housing units. Section 102 of Title X of P.L. 111-138 required HUD to conduct a study documenting trends in renter household characteristics for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 and report preliminary results to Congress. Having completed the study and further researched the period 2001 through 2015, this report includes analysis of trends in renter household characteristics, rent affordability, and rental housing conditions for the latter period and from 2017. GAO analyzed American Community Survey and American Housing Survey data for 2001 through 2017, interviewed relevant federal and academic experts, and reviewed HUD data analysis. In generally agreeing with its preliminary results, GAO suggests additional research on HUD housing measures in the 2018 National Affordable Housing Report. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has no comments on this report. The national rentership rate more than doubled from 2001 through 2017 from 22 to 36 percent. By 2017, a higher income share of households rented, and households with lower or no incomes experienced rent burdens—which occur if a household spends more than 30 percent of income in rent. Households within population groupings (e.g., younger households) and localities (e.g., areas with high or low-density housing) also differ in terms of renter characteristics. Additionally, Households with lower incomes were more likely to have severe rent burdens—spending more than 50 percent of income in rent—and have no choice but to be rent burdened. Renters in some groupings experienced the trend most (e.g., Hispanic and lower income households). Despite the ability to rent these units, minorities and other populations with significant rent burdens, continued competition for affordable housing may entail continued disrepair. Up to half of all renter households rented units with serious quality issues in 2017, according to indexes GAO developed. The types of issues vary but can result in housing that is not safe or healthy (e.g., a hole in the floor large enough to catch someone's foot)"]}
