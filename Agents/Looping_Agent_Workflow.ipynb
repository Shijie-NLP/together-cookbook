    "## Introduction\n",

    "In this notebook we'll create an agent workflow that continuously loops over and improves the response to a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow requires LLMs playing two different roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generator LLM**: An LLM that generates possible solutions to a task.\n",
    "- **Evaluator LLM**: An LLM that evaluates if the proposed solution meets certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generator starts off the workflow by generating a response. The Evaluator then assesses the solution based on various criteria that we provide to it and either accepts or rejects the solution. If the solution is rejected, the Evaluator provides feedback and guidance on how the problem can be fixed. The Generator then receives this feedback and proposes a new solution. This loop of iterative feedback and improvement continues until the Evaluator approves the solution."

    "In this **looping agent workflow**, we incrementally arrive at optimal solutions through structured evaluation and refinement cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is built around a straightforward Generator LLM that freely produces solutions to the given task, paired with a constrained Evaluator LLM that assesses against predefined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluator LLM outputs structured JSON verdicts containing both a PASS/FAIL status and actionable feedback, which feed back into the Generator LLM to produce increasingly refined solutions.\n",

      "The feedback highlights several areas for improvement in the `MinStack` implementation, including error handling, type hints, docstring formatting, method naming, return type consistency, and example usage separation. I will address these points to enhance the code's robustness and adherence to best practices.\n",

      "1. **Error Handling**: Ensure that the `pop` method does not raise an `IndexError` if the stack is empty.\n",

      "5. **Method Naming**: Rename `top` to `get_top_element` for clarity.\n",
      "6. **Return Type Consistency**: Ensure that the return types are consistent across methods.\n",
